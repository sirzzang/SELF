      "제목 : The Virus Can Be Stopped, but Only With Harsh Steps, Experts Say\n",
      "URL : https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-restrictions-us.html\n",
      "본문 : Terrifying though the coronavirus may be, it can be turned back. China, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan have demonstrated that, with furious efforts, the contagion can be brought to heel.\n",
      "Whether they can keep it suppressed remains to be seen. But for the United States to repeat their successes will take extraordinary levels of coordination and money from the country’s leaders, and extraordinary levels of trust and cooperation from citizens. It will also require international partnerships in an interconnected world.\n",
      "There is a chance to stop the coronavirus. This contagion has a weakness.\n",
      "Although there are incidents of rampant spread, as happened on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, the coronavirus more often infects clusters of family members, friends and work colleagues, said Dr. David L. Heymann, who chairs an expert panel advising the World Health Organization on emergencies.\n",
      "No one is certain why the virus travels in this way, but experts see an opening nonetheless. “You can contain clusters,” Dr. Heymann said. “You need to identify and stop discrete outbreaks, and then do rigorous contact tracing.”\n",
      "But doing so takes intelligent, rapidly adaptive work by health officials, and near-total cooperation from the populace. Containment becomes realistic only when Americans realize that working together is the only way to protect themselves and their loved ones.\n",
      "In interviews with a dozen of the world’s leading experts on fighting epidemics, there was wide agreement on the steps that must be taken immediately.\n",
      "Those experts included international public health officials who have fought AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, flu and Ebola; scientists and epidemiologists; and former health officials who led major American global health programs in both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n",
      "Americans must be persuaded to stay home, they said, and a system put in place to isolate the infected and care for them outside the home. Travel restrictions should be extended, they said; productions of masks and ventilators must be accelerated, and testing problems must be resolved.\n",
      "But tactics like forced isolation, school closings and pervasive GPS tracking of patients brought more divided reactions.\n",
      "It was not at all clear that a nation so fundamentally committed to individual liberty and distrustful of government could learn to adapt to many of these measures, especially those that smack of state compulsion.\n",
      "“The American way is to look for better outcomes through a voluntary system,” said Dr. Luciana Borio, who was director of medical and biodefense preparedness for the National Security Council before it was disbanded in 2018.\n",
      "“I think you can appeal to people to do the right thing.”\n",
      "In the week since the interviews began, remarkable changes have come over American life. State governments are telling residents they must stay home. Nonessential businesses are being shuttered.\n",
      "The streets are quieter than they have been in generations, and even friends keep a wary distance. What seemed unthinkable just a week ago is rapidly becoming the new normal.\n",
      "What follows are the recommendations offered by the experts interviewed by The Times.\n",
      "The White House holds frequent media briefings to describe the administration’s progress against the pandemic, often led by President Trump or Vice President Mike Pence, flanked by a rotating cast of officials.\n",
      "Many experts, some of whom are international civil servants, declined to speak on the record for fear of offending the president. But they were united in the opinion that politicians must step aside and let scientists both lead the effort to contain the virus and explain to Americans what must be done.\n",
      "Just as generals take the lead in giving daily briefings in wartime — as Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf did during the Persian Gulf war — medical experts should be at the microphone now to explain complex ideas like epidemic curves, social distancing and off-label use of drugs.\n",
      "The microphone should not even be at the White House, scientists said, so that briefings of historic importance do not dissolve into angry, politically charged exchanges with the press corps, as happened again on Friday.\n",
      "Instead, leaders must describe the looming crisis and the possible solutions in ways that will win the trust of Americans.\n",
      "Above all, the experts said, briefings should focus on saving lives and making sure that average wage earners survive the coming hard times — not on the stock market, the tourism industry or the president’s health. There is no time left to point fingers and assign blame.\n",
      "“At this point in the emergency, there’s little merit in spending time on what we should have done or who’s at fault,” said Adm. Tim Ziemer, who was the coordinator of the President’s Malaria Initiative from 2006 until early 2017 and led the pandemic response unit on the National Security Council before its disbanding.\n",
      "“We need to focus on the enemy, and that’s the virus.”\n",
      "The next priority, experts said, is extreme social distancing.\n",
      "If it were possible to wave a magic wand and make all Americans freeze in place for 14 days while sitting six feet apart, epidemiologists say, the whole epidemic would sputter to a halt.\n",
      "The virus would die out on every contaminated surface and, because almost everyone shows symptoms within two weeks, it would be evident who was infected. If we had enough tests for every American, even the completely asymptomatic cases could be found and isolated.\n",
      "The crisis would be over.\n",
      "Obviously, there is no magic wand, and no 300 million tests. But the goal of lockdowns and social distancing is to approximate such a total freeze.\n",
      "To attempt that, experts said, travel and human interaction must be reduced to a minimum.\n",
      "Italy moved incrementally: Officials slowly and reluctantly closed restaurants, churches and museums, and banned weddings and funerals. Nonetheless, the country’s death count continues to rise.\n",
      "The United States is slowly following suit. International flights are all but banned, but not domestic ones. California has ordered all residents to stay at home; New York was to shutter all nonessential businesses on Sunday evening.\n",
      "But other states have fewer restrictions, and in Florida, for days spring break revelers ignored government requests to clear the beaches.\n",
      "On Friday, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, chief medical adviser to the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said he advocated restrictive measures all across the country.\n",
      "In contrast to the halting steps taken here, China shut down Wuhan — the epicenter of the nation’s outbreak — and restricted movement in much of the country on Jan. 23, when the country had a mere 500 cases and 17 deaths.\n",
      "Its rapid action had an important effect: With the virus mostly isolated in one province, the rest of China was able to save Wuhan.\n",
      "Even as many cities fought their own smaller outbreaks, they sent 40,000 medical workers into Wuhan, roughly doubling its medical force.\n",
      "In a vast, largely closed society, it can be difficult to know what is happening on the ground, and there is no guarantee that the virus won’t roar back as the Chinese economy restarts.\n",
      "But the lesson is that relatively unaffected regions of the United States will be needed to help rescue overwhelmed cities like New York and Seattle. Keeping these areas at least somewhat free of the coronavirus means enacting strict measures, and quickly.\n",
      "Within cities, there are dangerous hot spots: One restaurant, one gym, one hospital, even one taxi may be more contaminated than many identical others nearby because someone had a coughing fit inside.\n",
      "Each day’s delay in stopping human contact, experts said, creates more hot spots, none of which can be identified until about a week later, when the people infected there start falling ill.\n",
      "To stop the explosion, municipal activity must be curtailed. Still, some Americans must stay on the job: doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers; police officers and firefighters; the technicians who maintain the electrical grid and gas and phone lines.\n",
      "The delivery of food and medicine must continue, so that people pinned in their homes suffer nothing worse than boredom. Those essential workers may eventually need permits, and a process for issuing them, if the police are needed to enforce stay-at-home orders, as they have been in China and Italy.\n",
      "People in lockdown adapt. In Wuhan, apartment complexes submit group orders for food, medicine, diapers and other essentials. Shipments are assembled at grocery warehouses or government pantries and dropped off. In Italy, trapped neighbors serenade one another.\n",
      "It’s an intimidating picture. But the weaker the freeze, the more people die in overburdened hospitals — and the longer it ultimately takes for the economy to restart.\n",
      "South Korea avoided locking down any city, but only by moving early and with extraordinary speed. In January, the country had four companies making tests, and as of March 9 had tested 210,000 citizens — the equivalent of testing 2.3 million Americans.\n",
      "As of the same date, fewer than 9,000 Americans had been tested.\n",
      "Everyone who is infected in South Korea goes into isolation in government shelters, and phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. Where they walked before they fell ill is broadcast to the cellphones of everyone who was nearby.\n",
      "Anyone even potentially exposed is quarantined at home; a GPS app tells the police if that person goes outside. The fine for doing so is $8,000.\n",
      "British researchers are trying to develop a similar tracking app, albeit one more palatable to citizens in Western democracies.\n",
      "Testing must be done in a coordinated and safe way, experts said. The seriously ill must go first, and the testers must be protected.\n",
      "In China, those seeking a test must describe their symptoms on a telemedicine website. If a nurse decides a test is warranted, they are directed to one of dozens of “fever clinics” set up far from all other patients.\n",
      "Personnel in head-to-toe gear check their fevers and question them. Then, ideally, patients are given a rapid flu test and a white blood cell count is taken to rule out influenza and bacterial pneumonia.\n",
      "Then their lungs are visualized in a CT scanner to look for “ground-glass opacities” that indicate pneumonia and rule out cancer and tuberculosis. Only then are they given a diagnostic test for the coronavirus — and they are told to wait at the testing center.\n",
      "The results take a minimum of four hours; in the past, if results took overnight, patients were moved to a hotel to wait — sometimes for two to three days, if doctors believed retesting was warranted. It can take several days after an exposure for a test to turn positive.\n",
      "In the United States, people seeking tests are calling their doctors, who may not have them, or sometimes waiting in traffic jams leading to store parking lots. On Friday, New York City limited testing only to those patients requiring hospitalization, saying the system was being overwhelmed.\n",
      "As soon as possible, experts said, the United States must develop an alternative to the practice of isolating infected people at home, as it endangers families. In China, 75 to 80 percent of all transmission occurred in family clusters.\n",
      "That pattern has already repeated itself here. Seven members of a large family in New Jersey were infected; four have already died. After a lawyer in New Rochelle, N.Y., fell ill, his wife, son and daughter all tested positive.\n",
      "Instead of a policy that advises the infected to remain at home, as the Centers for Disease and Prevention now does, experts said cities should establish facilities where the mildly and moderately ill can recuperate under the care and observation of nurses.\n",
      "Wuhan created many such centers, called “temporary hospitals,” each a cross between a dormitory and a first-aid clinic. They had cots and oxygen tanks, but not the advanced machines used in intensive care units.\n",
      "American cities now have many spaces that could serve as isolation wards. Already New York is considering turning the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center into a temporary hospital, along with the Westchester Convention Center and two university campuses.\n",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said on Saturday that state officials were also considering opening isolation wards.\n",
      "In China, said Dr. Bruce Aylward, leader of the World Health Organization’s observer team there, people originally resisted leaving home or seeing their children go into isolation centers with no visiting rights — just as Americans no doubt would.\n",
      "In China, they came to accept it.\n",
      "“They realized they were keeping their families safe,” he said. “Also, isolation is really lonely. It’s psychologically difficult. Here, they were all together with other people in the same boat. They supported each other.”\n",
      "Because China, Taiwan and Vietnam were hit by SARS in 2003, and South Korea has grappled with MERS, fever checks during disease outbreaks became routine.\n",
      "In most cities in affected Asian countries, it is commonplace before entering any bus, train or subway station, office building, theater or even a restaurant to get a temperature check. Washing your hands in chlorinated water is often also required.\n",
      "“They give you a sticker afterward,” said Dr. Heymann, who recently spent a week teaching in Singapore. “I built up quite a collection.”\n",
      "In China, having a fever means a mandatory trip to a fever clinic to check for coronavirus. In the Wuhan area, different cities took different approaches.\n",
      "Cellphone videos from China show police officers knocking on doors and taking temperatures. In some, people who resist are dragged away by force. The city of Ningbo offered bounties of $1,400 to anyone who turned in a coronavirus sufferer.\n",
      "The city of Qianjiang, by contrast, offered the same amount of money to any resident who came in voluntarily and tested positive.\n",
      "Some measures made Western experts queasy. It is difficult to imagine Americans permitting a family member with a fever to be dragged to an isolation ward where visitors are not permitted.\n",
      "“A lot of people’s rights were violated,” Dr. Borio said.\n",
      "Voluntary approaches, like explaining to patients that they will be keeping family and friends safe, are more likely to work in the West, she added.\n",
      "Finding and testing all the contacts of every positive case is essential, experts said. At the peak of its epidemic, Wuhan had 18,000 people tracking down individuals who had come in contact with the infected.\n",
      "At the moment, the health departments of some American counties lack the manpower to trace even syphilis or tuberculosis, let alone scores of casual contacts of someone infected with the coronavirus.\n",
      "Dr. Borio suggested that young Americans could use their social networks to “do their own contact tracing.” Social media also is used in Asia, but in different ways.\n",
      "China’s strategy is quite intrusive: To use the subway in some cities, citizens must download an app that rates how great a health risk they are. South Korean apps tell users exactly where infected people have traveled.\n",
      "When he lectured at a Singapore university, Dr. Heymann said, dozens of students were in the room. But just before he began class, they were photographed to record where everyone sat.\n",
      "“That way, if someone turns up infected later, you can find out who sat near them,” Dr. Heymann said. “That’s really clever.”\n",
      "Contacts generally must remain home for 14 days and report their temperatures twice a day.\n",
      "American experts have divided opinions about masks, but those who have worked in Asia see their value.\n",
      "There is very little data showing that flat surgical masks protect healthy individuals from disease. Nonetheless, Asian countries generally make it mandatory that people wear them. In China, the police even used drones to chase individuals down streets, ordering them to go home and mask up.\n",
      "The Asian approach is less about data than it is about crowd psychology, experts explained.\n",
      "All experts agree that the sick must wear masks to keep in their coughs. But if a mask indicates that the wearer is sick, many people will be reluctant to wear one. If everyone is required to wear masks, the sick automatically have one on and there is no stigma attached.\n",
      "Also, experts emphasized, Americans should be taught to take seriously admonitions to stop shaking hands and hugging. The “W.H.O. elbow bump” may look funny, but it’s a legitimate technique for preventing infection.\n",
      "“In Asia, where they went through SARS, people understand the danger,” Dr. Heymann said. “It’s instilled in the population that you’ve got to do the right thing.”\n",
      "Federal intervention is necessary for some vital aspects of life during a pandemic.\n",
      "Only the federal government can enforce interstate commerce laws to ensure that food, water, electricity, gas, phone lines and other basic needs keep flowing across state lines to cities and suburbs.\n",
      "Mr. Trump has said he could compel companies to prioritize making ventilators, masks and other needed goods. Some have volunteered; the Hanes underwear company, for example, will use its cotton to make masks for hospital workers.\n",
      "He also has the military; the Navy is committing two hospital ships to the fight. And Mr. Trump can call up the National Guard. As of Saturday evening, more than 6,500 National Guard members already are assisting in the coronavirus response in 38 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.\n",
      "High-level decisions like these must be made quickly, experts said.\n",
      "“Many Western political leaders are behaving as though they are on a tightrope,” said Dr. David Nabarro, a W.H.O. special envoy on Covid-19 and a veteran of fights against SARS, Ebola and cholera.\n",
      "“But there is no choice. We must do all in our power to fight this,” he added. “I sense that most people — and certainly those in business — get it. They would prefer to take the bitter medicine at once and contain outbreaks as they start rather than gamble with uncertainty.”\n",
      "The roughly 175,000 ventilators in all American hospitals and the national stockpile are expected to be far fewer than are needed to handle a surge of patients desperate for breath.\n",
      "The machines pump air and oxygen into the lungs, but they normally cost $25,000 or more each, and neither individual hospitals nor the federal emergency stockpile has ever had enough on hand to handle the number of pneumonia patients that this pandemic is expected to produce.\n",
      "New York, for example, has found about 6,000 ventilators for purchase around the world, Governor Cuomo said. He estimated the state would need about 30,000.\n",
      "The manufacturers, including a dozen in the United States, say there is no easy way to ramp up production quickly. But it is possible other manufacturers, including aerospace and automobile companies, could be enlisted to do so.\n",
      "Ventilators are basically air pumps with motors controlled by circuits that make them act like lungs: the pump pushes air into the patient, then stops so the weight of the chest can push the air back out.\n",
      "Automobiles and airplanes contain many small pumps, like those for oil, water and air-conditioning fluid, that might be modified to act as basic, stripped-down ventilators. On Sunday, Mr. Trump tweeted that Ford and General Motors had been “given the go-ahead” to produce ventilators.\n",
      "Providers, meanwhile, are scrambling for alternatives.\n",
      "Canadian nurses are disseminating a 2006 paper describing how one ventilator can be modified to treat four patients simultaneously. Inventors have proposed combining C-PAP machines, which many apnea sufferers own, and oxygen tanks to improvise a ventilator.\n",
      "The United States must also work to increase its supply of piped and tanked oxygen, Dr. Aylward said.\n",
      "One of the lessons of China, he noted, was that many Covid-19 patients who would normally have been intubated and on ventilators managed to survive with oxygen alone.\n",
      "Hospitals in the United States have taken some measures to handle surges of patients, such as stopping elective surgery and setting up isolation rooms.\n",
      "To protect bedridden long-term patients, nursing homes and hospitals also should immediately stop admitting visitors and do constant health checks on their staffs, said Dr. James LeDuc, director of the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch.\n",
      "The national stockpile does contain some prepackaged military field hospitals, but they are not expected to be nearly enough for a big surge.\n",
      "In Wuhan, the Chinese government famously built two new hospitals in two weeks. All other hospitals were divided: 48 were designated to handle 10,000 serious or critical coronavirus patients, while others were restricted to handling emergencies like heart attacks and births.\n",
      "Wherever that was impractical, hospitals were divided into “clean” and “dirty” zones, and the medical teams did not cross over. Walls to isolate whole wards were built, and — as in Ebola wards — doctors went in one end of the room wearing protective gear and left by the other end, where they de-gowned under the eyes of a nurse to prevent infection.\n",
      "As of Saturday, schools in 45 states were closed entirely, but that is a decision that divided experts.\n",
      "“Closing all schools may not make sense unless there is documented widespread community transmission, which we’re not seeing in most of the country,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former C.D.C. director under President Barack Obama.\n",
      "It is unclear how much children spread coronavirus. They very seldom get sick enough to be hospitalized, which is not true of flu. Current testing cannot tell whether most do not even become infected.\n",
      "In China, Dr. Aylward said, he asked all of the doctors he spoke to whether they had seen any family clusters in which a child was the first to be infected. No one had, he said, which astonished him.\n",
      "That leaves a quandary. Closing schools is a normal part of social distancing; after all, schools are the workplaces for many adults, too. And when the disease is clearly spreading within an individual school, it must close.\n",
      "But closing whole school districts can seriously disrupt a city’s ability to fight an outbreak. With their children stuck at home, nurses, doctors, police officers and other emergency medical workers cannot come to work.\n",
      "Also, many children in low-income families depend on the meals they eat at schools.\n",
      "Cities that close all schools are creating special “hub schools” for the children of essential workers. In Ohio, the governor has told school bus drivers to deliver hot meals to children who normally got them at school.\n",
      "China’s effort succeeded, experts said, in part because of hundreds of thousands of volunteers. The government declared a “people’s war” and rolled out a “Fight On, Wuhan! Fight On, China!” campaign.\n",
      "It made inspirational films that combined airline ads with 1940s-style wartime propaganda. The ads were somewhat corny, but they rallied the public.\n",
      "Many people idled by the lockdowns stepped up to act as fever checkers, contact tracers, hospital construction workers, food deliverers, even babysitters for the children of first responders, or as crematory workers.\n",
      "With training, volunteers were able to do some ground-level but crucial medical tasks, such as basic nursing, lab technician work or making sure that hospital rooms were correctly decontaminated.\n",
      "Americans often step forward to help neighbors affected by hurricanes and floods; many will no doubt do so in this outbreak, but they will need training in how not to fall ill and add to the problem.\n",
      "“In my experience, success is dependent on how much the public is informed and participates,” Admiral Ziemer said. “This truly is an ‘all hands on deck’ situation.”\n",
      "Clinicians in China, Italy and France have thrown virtually everything they had in hospital pharmacies into the fight, and at least two possibilities have emerged that might save patients: the anti-malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and the antiviral remdesivir, which has no licensed use.\n",
      "There is not proof yet that any of these are effective against the virus. China registered more than 200 clinical trials, including several involving those treatments, but investigators ran out of patients in critical condition to enroll. Italy and France have trials underway, and hospitals in New York are writing trial protocols now.\n",
      "One worry for trial leaders is that chloroquine has been given so much publicity that patients may refuse to be “randomized” and accept a 50 percent chance of being given a placebo.\n",
      "If any drug works on critical cases, it might be possible to use small doses as a prophylactic to prevent infection.\n",
      "An alternative is to harvest protective antibodies from the blood of people who have survived the illness, said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\n",
      "The purified blood serum — called immunoglobulin — could possibly be used in small amounts to protect emergency medical workers, too.\n",
      "“Unfortunately, the first wave won’t benefit from this,” Dr. Hotez said. “We need to wait until we have enough survivors.”\n",
      "The ultimate hope is to have a vaccine that will protect everyone, and many companies and governments have already rushed the design of candidate vaccines. But as Dr. Fauci has explained multiple times, testing those candidate vaccines for safety and effectiveness takes time.\n",
      "The process will take at least a year, even if nothing goes wrong. The roadblock, vaccine experts explained, is not bureaucratic. It is that the human immune system takes weeks to produce antibodies, and some dangerous side effects can take weeks to appear.\n",
      "After extensive animal testing, vaccines are normally given to about 50 healthy human volunteers to see if they cause any unexpected side effects and to measure what dose produces enough antibodies to be considered protective.\n",
      "If that goes well, the trial enrolls hundreds or thousands of volunteers in an area where the virus is circulating. Half get the vaccine, the rest do not — and the investigators wait. If the vaccinated half do not get the disease, the green light for production is finally given.\n",
      "In the past, some experimental vaccines have produced serious side effects, like Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can paralyze and kill. A greater danger, experts said, is that some experimental vaccines, paradoxically, cause “immune enhancement,” meaning they make it more likely, not less, that recipients will get a disease. That would be a disaster.\n",
      "One candidate coronavirus vaccine Dr. Hotez invented 10 years ago in the wake of SARS, he said, had to be abandoned when it appeared to make mice more likely to die from pneumonia when they were experimentally infected with the virus.\n",
      "In theory, the testing process could be sped up with “challenge trials,” in which healthy volunteers get the vaccine and then are deliberately infected. But that is ethically fraught when there is no cure for Covid-19. Even some healthy young people have died from this virus.\n",
      "Wealthy nations need to remember that, as much as they are struggling with the virus, poorer countries will have a far harder time and need help.\n",

      "The internet is playing an increasingly important role in mobilizing humanitarian response. Grassroots coalitions are now built by e-mail and text messages. Mainstream media outlets continually rely on stories researched and broken by bloggers and are no putting more resources into their own websites. Bloggers and independent journalists are even utilizing other internet tools, such as YouTube, in addition to their blogs as a way of raising awareness about issues as well as for fundraising. Such wide access to the internet and the proliferation of blogs has enabled coverage of war and humanitarian issues from different perspectives.\n",
      "This seminar explored the role of new media technologies in mobilizing humanitarian response. What is the balance between mainstream and new forms of media coverage? Do they cover different issues? Cover the same issues differently? Reach different audiences? How are different humanitarian actors using the new possibilities offered by technology? \n",

LG전자 노이다 공장과 푸네 공장에서는 세탁기 등 가전제품을 생산하고 있다. 푸네 공장에서는 스마트폰도 일부 생산한다.업계 관계자는 “현지 주정부의 방침에 따라 가동을 중단했다”며 “해당 기간 이후 생산재개를 계획하고 있지만 현지 상황을 예의주시하고 있다”고 말했다.현대차도 인도 첸나이 공장 가동을 이달 말까지 중단한다. 현대차 첸나이공장은 SUV 크레타과 싼타페, 이온, i20, 엘란트라, 엑센트 등의 차종을 연간 68만여대를 생산한다.기아차의 인도 현지 공장인 안드라프라데시 공장은 아직 주정부의 지침이 내려오지 않아 가동 중단에 들어가지 않았지만 임직원의 건강을 고려해 가동 중단을 검토하고 있다. 현대차와 마찬가지로 셧다운 될 가능성이 매우 높은 상황이다.앞서 현대기아차는 미국과 유럽 내 현지 공장의 가동 중단도 결정했다. 현대차의 체코공장과 기아차 슬로바키아 공장 모두 이날부터 다음 달 3일까지 생산을 멈춘다.미국 앨라배마 공장은 이달 18일 이미 가동을 멈췄다. 공장 내 직원 1명이 코로나19 양성 판정을 받으면서 셧다운 된 것이다.이처럼 현대기아차의 글로벌 공장이 코로나19 여파로 속속 가동을 멈추면서 현대기아차는 '비상경영 체제'에 들어갔다.회사 차원에서 실시하고 있던 재택근무를 이날부로 모두 중단하고 출근을 시작했다. 다만 임신부와 지병이 있는 환자 등은 이번 조치에서 제외했다.현대기아차 관계자는 \"비상 경영 차원에서 내려진 조치\"라며 \"사업 운영에 차질이 예상되니 예방 차원에서 진행한 조치이며 동시에 직원 간 접촉을 최소화하면서 안전한 업무환경을 유지하고 있다\"고 설명했다.▶ 코로나19 확산 관련기사 모음▶ 클릭 한 번이면 노컷뉴스 구독!▶ 보다 나은 세상, 노컷브이와 함께apple@cbs.co.kr저작권자 © CBS 노컷뉴스 무단전재 및 재배포 금지\n",

      "본문 : LONDON/BOSTON (Reuters) - Central banks have offered trillions of dollars of support to markets in recent days to keep them from freezing up, as investors worried about the economic damage from the coronavirus and made a chaotic dash for the exits.  FILE PHOTO: A trader wears a mask as he works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as the building prepares to close indefinitely due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in New York, U.S., March 20, 2020.  REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File PhotoWhile the intervention helped bring back some order to markets, policymakers may need to do more. Investors, economists and bank strategists said they expect policymakers will have to step in with more support in the coming days to prop up both markets and the real economy - companies losing customers and workers thrown out of jobs. There is a limit for now to how effective authorities can be, however, some said. Before investors calm down, these observers said, they will need to see a peak in new virus infection rates, an improvement in hospitals’ ability to cope with an influx of patients, and an end in sight to the economy-killing quarantines, travel bans and other restrictions being imposed to save lives. “The best that economic and financial policymakers can do right now is limit the damage. They cannot turn the economy around because this is a health issue, not an economic or financial issue,” said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor to the German insurer Allianz SE < ALVG.DE>, in an interview. Estimates of the sums required to keep Corporate America afloat are reaching eye-popping levels. Ray Dalio, founder of hedge fund giant Bridgewater Associates LP, estimates the financial losses for U.S. companies from the coronavirus-induced slump could be about $4 trillion. That’s nearly one-fifth the value of America’s total economic output last year. The government will have to come to the rescue, Dalio told Reuters via email, backed by a central bank that prints money. “What needs to happen is very similar to what happened in the war years, but without the fighting,” Dalio said. Governments ramped up their support quickly in recent days as it became clear that the scale of the hit from the virus is likely to be huge. Last week was the worst since 2008 for the U.S. stock market. Less visible is the stress building up in other markets that keep the real economy humming, such as the markets where companies go to raise short term cash to pay staff and where cities go to raise money for roads and schools. Many central bank measures have been aimed at reducing the strain in those areas. These steps have ranged from slashing interest rates and ramping up bond buying programs to the Federal Reserve’s resurrection of funding facilities from the financial-crisis era. These steps have eased the strain, but analysts and investors said they didn’t go far enough, and new areas of concern have emerged.  One success: The Fed has made it easier for other nations’ central banks to obtain dollars to meet runaway global demand for the greenback. As the Fed acted, a key measure of the premium investors pay to access the U.S. currency fell to its lowest level since March 3. The measure, known as the euro-dollar EURCBS3M=ICAP swap spread, fell to less than 4 basis points, or 0.04%, on Friday after going as wide as 86 basis points on Monday. But in a sign that the thirst for dollars globally remained unsatiated, the U.S. currency remained strong. A spokesman for the Fed declined to comment on a request sent Sunday evening. Traders also complained during the week about problems trading U.S. government bonds and other kinds of debt amid large price swings. There has been a shortage of buyers despite the Fed providing more funding and purchasing some types of assets. Yields continued to rise in municipal debt markets, for example, where the Fed’s support was limited to short-term debt and highly rated issuers. Yields rise when bond prices fall. In commercial paper markets, where companies go to access short-term funding, the Fed launched on Tuesday a new facility that buys commercial paper from highly rated companies. It helped, said Blake Gwinn, a strategist at NatWest Markets Plc, but the borrowing costs were higher than expected and the facility was too limited in targeting the strongest borrowers. In a research note Friday, he wrote that without significant changes, the program “would not do much to unclog” the commercial paper market. Gwinn, a former trader for the New York Federal Reserve, said the central bank should become a direct buyer of clogged assets, rather than “merely providing funding and hoping” that banks and other players will do the heavy lifting.  Some analysts and industry sources argued for loosening of bank regulations which, in their view, are restricting liquidity - the ability to easily buy and sell assets. Suspending these rules, they argue, will make it easier for banks to step in as market makers and lenders in a bigger way. “The next crucial step in aiding liquidity will be to ease bank regulatory constraints,” TD Securities strategists wrote in a note. HIGH VOLATILITY One sign that the measures so far are insufficient: persistent volatility in markets. Volatility - large ups and downs in asset prices - is at extreme levels, as measured through indicators such as the market fear gauge  in stocks and the Deutsche Bank Currency Volatility Index .DBCVIX in currencies. High levels of volatility have forced funds and banks to sell their positions or step back from market-making, the all-important role of go-between in big trades, as they try to keep the amount of risk in their portfolios in check, bank strategists said. That, in turn, has led to more sellers than buyers, resulting in gaps between bid and offer prices of assets, which exacerbates market volatility. Some of the measures taken by the Fed - such as buying bonds and lending money to banks so they can step in as buyers for some of these assets - are aimed at ending that logjam. But these steps have not managed to soothe the markets. One example is the market for Treasury bonds, one of the world’s most liquid assets. Prices continued swinging sharply last week. In normal times, Treasury yields move a few basis points, or hundredths of a percent. The 10-year Treasury US10YT=RR saw a 43-basis-point swing in yield on Friday, versus a swing of about 27 points on Wednesday and Thursday.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File PhotoAnother concern for central banks that is gaining more urgency: corporate credit. U.S. and European corporate debt markets have seized up, with markets for new issuance of bonds virtually shut and spreads spiking in secondary markets. The costs that companies pay to borrow in bond markets have surged to multi-year highs and remain highly elevated despite the central bank moves. Adding to the stress, ratings agencies have started downgrading companies as the revenue squeeze gets worse. Allianz’s El-Erian said he suspected that a coordinated U.S. Treasury and Fed attempt is in the works to counter market failures in areas U.S. authorities have not yet targeted, such as the market for corporate credit. That intervention, he predicted, would be made “over the next few days, not even weeks.”     Additional reporting by Ritvik Carvalho and Sujata Rao in London, and Megan Davies and Jessica DiNapoli in New York.; Editing by Paritosh Bansal, Mike Williams and Edward TobinOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n"

      "본문 : \n",
      "The internet is playing an increasingly important role in mobilizing humanitarian response. Grassroots coalitions are now built by e-mail and text messages. Mainstream media outlets continually rely on stories researched and broken by bloggers and are no putting more resources into their own websites. Bloggers and independent journalists are even utilizing other internet tools, such as YouTube, in addition to their blogs as a way of raising awareness about issues as well as for fundraising. Such wide access to the internet and the proliferation of blogs has enabled coverage of war and humanitarian issues from different perspectives.\n",
      "This seminar explored the role of new media technologies in mobilizing humanitarian response. What is the balance between mainstream and new forms of media coverage? Do they cover different issues? Cover the same issues differently? Reach different audiences? How are different humanitarian actors using the new possibilities offered by technology? \n",

      "제목 : The Virus Can Be Stopped, but Only With Harsh Steps, Experts Say\n",
      "Latest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak\n",
      "본문 : Terrifying though the coronavirus may be, it can be turned back. China, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan have demonstrated that, with furious efforts, the contagion can be brought to heel.\n",
      "Whether they can keep it suppressed remains to be seen. But for the United States to repeat their successes will take extraordinary levels of coordination and money from the country’s leaders, and extraordinary levels of trust and cooperation from citizens. It will also require international partnerships in an interconnected world.\n",
      "There is a chance to stop the coronavirus. This contagion has a weakness.\n",
      "Although there are incidents of rampant spread, as happened on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, the coronavirus more often infects clusters of family members, friends and work colleagues, said Dr. David L. Heymann, who chairs an expert panel advising the World Health Organization on emergencies.\n",
      "No one is certain why the virus travels in this way, but experts see an opening nonetheless. “You can contain clusters,” Dr. Heymann said. “You need to identify and stop discrete outbreaks, and then do rigorous contact tracing.”\n",
      "But doing so takes intelligent, rapidly adaptive work by health officials, and near-total cooperation from the populace. Containment becomes realistic only when Americans realize that working together is the only way to protect themselves and their loved ones.\n",
      "In interviews with a dozen of the world’s leading experts on fighting epidemics, there was wide agreement on the steps that must be taken immediately.\n",
      "Those experts included international public health officials who have fought AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, flu and Ebola; scientists and epidemiologists; and former health officials who led major American global health programs in both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n",
      "Americans must be persuaded to stay home, they said, and a system put in place to isolate the infected and care for them outside the home. Travel restrictions should be extended, they said; productions of masks and ventilators must be accelerated, and testing problems must be resolved.\n",
      "But tactics like forced isolation, school closings and pervasive GPS tracking of patients brought more divided reactions.\n",
      "It was not at all clear that a nation so fundamentally committed to individual liberty and distrustful of government could learn to adapt to many of these measures, especially those that smack of state compulsion.\n",
      "“The American way is to look for better outcomes through a voluntary system,” said Dr. Luciana Borio, who was director of medical and biodefense preparedness for the National Security Council before it was disbanded in 2018.\n",
      "“I think you can appeal to people to do the right thing.”\n",
      "In the week since the interviews began, remarkable changes have come over American life. State governments are telling residents they must stay home. Nonessential businesses are being shuttered.\n",
      "The streets are quieter than they have been in generations, and even friends keep a wary distance. What seemed unthinkable just a week ago is rapidly becoming the new normal.\n",
      "What follows are the recommendations offered by the experts interviewed by The Times.\n",
      "The White House holds frequent media briefings to describe the administration’s progress against the pandemic, often led by President Trump or Vice President Mike Pence, flanked by a rotating cast of officials.\n",
      "Many experts, some of whom are international civil servants, declined to speak on the record for fear of offending the president. But they were united in the opinion that politicians must step aside and let scientists both lead the effort to contain the virus and explain to Americans what must be done.\n",
      "Just as generals take the lead in giving daily briefings in wartime — as Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf did during the Persian Gulf war — medical experts should be at the microphone now to explain complex ideas like epidemic curves, social distancing and off-label use of drugs.\n",
      "The microphone should not even be at the White House, scientists said, so that briefings of historic importance do not dissolve into angry, politically charged exchanges with the press corps, as happened again on Friday.\n",
      "Instead, leaders must describe the looming crisis and the possible solutions in ways that will win the trust of Americans.\n",
      "Above all, the experts said, briefings should focus on saving lives and making sure that average wage earners survive the coming hard times — not on the stock market, the tourism industry or the president’s health. There is no time left to point fingers and assign blame.\n",
      "“At this point in the emergency, there’s little merit in spending time on what we should have done or who’s at fault,” said Adm. Tim Ziemer, who was the coordinator of the President’s Malaria Initiative from 2006 until early 2017 and led the pandemic response unit on the National Security Council before its disbanding.\n",
      "“We need to focus on the enemy, and that’s the virus.”\n",
      "The next priority, experts said, is extreme social distancing.\n",
      "If it were possible to wave a magic wand and make all Americans freeze in place for 14 days while sitting six feet apart, epidemiologists say, the whole epidemic would sputter to a halt.\n",
      "The virus would die out on every contaminated surface and, because almost everyone shows symptoms within two weeks, it would be evident who was infected. If we had enough tests for every American, even the completely asymptomatic cases could be found and isolated.\n",
      "The crisis would be over.\n",
      "Obviously, there is no magic wand, and no 300 million tests. But the goal of lockdowns and social distancing is to approximate such a total freeze.\n",
      "To attempt that, experts said, travel and human interaction must be reduced to a minimum.\n",
      "Italy moved incrementally: Officials slowly and reluctantly closed restaurants, churches and museums, and banned weddings and funerals. Nonetheless, the country’s death count continues to rise.\n",
      "The United States is slowly following suit. International flights are all but banned, but not domestic ones. California has ordered all residents to stay at home; New York was to shutter all nonessential businesses on Sunday evening.\n",
      "But other states have fewer restrictions, and in Florida, for days spring break revelers ignored government requests to clear the beaches.\n",
      "On Friday, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, chief medical adviser to the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said he advocated restrictive measures all across the country.\n",
      "In contrast to the halting steps taken here, China shut down Wuhan — the epicenter of the nation’s outbreak — and restricted movement in much of the country on Jan. 23, when the country had a mere 500 cases and 17 deaths.\n",
      "Its rapid action had an important effect: With the virus mostly isolated in one province, the rest of China was able to save Wuhan.\n",
      "Even as many cities fought their own smaller outbreaks, they sent 40,000 medical workers into Wuhan, roughly doubling its medical force.\n",
      "In a vast, largely closed society, it can be difficult to know what is happening on the ground, and there is no guarantee that the virus won’t roar back as the Chinese economy restarts.\n",
      "But the lesson is that relatively unaffected regions of the United States will be needed to help rescue overwhelmed cities like New York and Seattle. Keeping these areas at least somewhat free of the coronavirus means enacting strict measures, and quickly.\n",
      "Within cities, there are dangerous hot spots: One restaurant, one gym, one hospital, even one taxi may be more contaminated than many identical others nearby because someone had a coughing fit inside.\n",
      "Each day’s delay in stopping human contact, experts said, creates more hot spots, none of which can be identified until about a week later, when the people infected there start falling ill.\n",
      "To stop the explosion, municipal activity must be curtailed. Still, some Americans must stay on the job: doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers; police officers and firefighters; the technicians who maintain the electrical grid and gas and phone lines.\n",
      "The delivery of food and medicine must continue, so that people pinned in their homes suffer nothing worse than boredom. Those essential workers may eventually need permits, and a process for issuing them, if the police are needed to enforce stay-at-home orders, as they have been in China and Italy.\n",
      "People in lockdown adapt. In Wuhan, apartment complexes submit group orders for food, medicine, diapers and other essentials. Shipments are assembled at grocery warehouses or government pantries and dropped off. In Italy, trapped neighbors serenade one another.\n",
      "It’s an intimidating picture. But the weaker the freeze, the more people die in overburdened hospitals — and the longer it ultimately takes for the economy to restart.\n",
      "South Korea avoided locking down any city, but only by moving early and with extraordinary speed. In January, the country had four companies making tests, and as of March 9 had tested 210,000 citizens — the equivalent of testing 2.3 million Americans.\n",
      "As of the same date, fewer than 9,000 Americans had been tested.\n",
      "Everyone who is infected in South Korea goes into isolation in government shelters, and phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. Where they walked before they fell ill is broadcast to the cellphones of everyone who was nearby.\n",
      "Anyone even potentially exposed is quarantined at home; a GPS app tells the police if that person goes outside. The fine for doing so is $8,000.\n",
      "British researchers are trying to develop a similar tracking app, albeit one more palatable to citizens in Western democracies.\n",
      "Testing must be done in a coordinated and safe way, experts said. The seriously ill must go first, and the testers must be protected.\n",
      "In China, those seeking a test must describe their symptoms on a telemedicine website. If a nurse decides a test is warranted, they are directed to one of dozens of “fever clinics” set up far from all other patients.\n",
      "Personnel in head-to-toe gear check their fevers and question them. Then, ideally, patients are given a rapid flu test and a white blood cell count is taken to rule out influenza and bacterial pneumonia.\n",
      "Then their lungs are visualized in a CT scanner to look for “ground-glass opacities” that indicate pneumonia and rule out cancer and tuberculosis. Only then are they given a diagnostic test for the coronavirus — and they are told to wait at the testing center.\n",
      "The results take a minimum of four hours; in the past, if results took overnight, patients were moved to a hotel to wait — sometimes for two to three days, if doctors believed retesting was warranted. It can take several days after an exposure for a test to turn positive.\n",
      "In the United States, people seeking tests are calling their doctors, who may not have them, or sometimes waiting in traffic jams leading to store parking lots. On Friday, New York City limited testing only to those patients requiring hospitalization, saying the system was being overwhelmed.\n",
      "As soon as possible, experts said, the United States must develop an alternative to the practice of isolating infected people at home, as it endangers families. In China, 75 to 80 percent of all transmission occurred in family clusters.\n",
      "That pattern has already repeated itself here. Seven members of a large family in New Jersey were infected; four have already died. After a lawyer in New Rochelle, N.Y., fell ill, his wife, son and daughter all tested positive.\n",
      "Instead of a policy that advises the infected to remain at home, as the Centers for Disease and Prevention now does, experts said cities should establish facilities where the mildly and moderately ill can recuperate under the care and observation of nurses.\n",
      "Wuhan created many such centers, called “temporary hospitals,” each a cross between a dormitory and a first-aid clinic. They had cots and oxygen tanks, but not the advanced machines used in intensive care units.\n",
      "American cities now have many spaces that could serve as isolation wards. Already New York is considering turning the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center into a temporary hospital, along with the Westchester Convention Center and two university campuses.\n",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said on Saturday that state officials were also considering opening isolation wards.\n",
      "In China, said Dr. Bruce Aylward, leader of the World Health Organization’s observer team there, people originally resisted leaving home or seeing their children go into isolation centers with no visiting rights — just as Americans no doubt would.\n",
      "In China, they came to accept it.\n",
      "“They realized they were keeping their families safe,” he said. “Also, isolation is really lonely. It’s psychologically difficult. Here, they were all together with other people in the same boat. They supported each other.”\n",
      "Because China, Taiwan and Vietnam were hit by SARS in 2003, and South Korea has grappled with MERS, fever checks during disease outbreaks became routine.\n",
      "In most cities in affected Asian countries, it is commonplace before entering any bus, train or subway station, office building, theater or even a restaurant to get a temperature check. Washing your hands in chlorinated water is often also required.\n",
      "“They give you a sticker afterward,” said Dr. Heymann, who recently spent a week teaching in Singapore. “I built up quite a collection.”\n",
      "In China, having a fever means a mandatory trip to a fever clinic to check for coronavirus. In the Wuhan area, different cities took different approaches.\n",
      "Cellphone videos from China show police officers knocking on doors and taking temperatures. In some, people who resist are dragged away by force. The city of Ningbo offered bounties of $1,400 to anyone who turned in a coronavirus sufferer.\n",
      "The city of Qianjiang, by contrast, offered the same amount of money to any resident who came in voluntarily and tested positive.\n",
      "Some measures made Western experts queasy. It is difficult to imagine Americans permitting a family member with a fever to be dragged to an isolation ward where visitors are not permitted.\n",
      "“A lot of people’s rights were violated,” Dr. Borio said.\n",
      "Voluntary approaches, like explaining to patients that they will be keeping family and friends safe, are more likely to work in the West, she added.\n",
      "Finding and testing all the contacts of every positive case is essential, experts said. At the peak of its epidemic, Wuhan had 18,000 people tracking down individuals who had come in contact with the infected.\n",
      "At the moment, the health departments of some American counties lack the manpower to trace even syphilis or tuberculosis, let alone scores of casual contacts of someone infected with the coronavirus.\n",
      "Dr. Borio suggested that young Americans could use their social networks to “do their own contact tracing.” Social media also is used in Asia, but in different ways.\n",
      "China’s strategy is quite intrusive: To use the subway in some cities, citizens must download an app that rates how great a health risk they are. South Korean apps tell users exactly where infected people have traveled.\n",
      "When he lectured at a Singapore university, Dr. Heymann said, dozens of students were in the room. But just before he began class, they were photographed to record where everyone sat.\n",
      "“That way, if someone turns up infected later, you can find out who sat near them,” Dr. Heymann said. “That’s really clever.”\n",
      "Contacts generally must remain home for 14 days and report their temperatures twice a day.\n",
      "American experts have divided opinions about masks, but those who have worked in Asia see their value.\n",
      "There is very little data showing that flat surgical masks protect healthy individuals from disease. Nonetheless, Asian countries generally make it mandatory that people wear them. In China, the police even used drones to chase individuals down streets, ordering them to go home and mask up.\n",
      "The Asian approach is less about data than it is about crowd psychology, experts explained.\n",
      "All experts agree that the sick must wear masks to keep in their coughs. But if a mask indicates that the wearer is sick, many people will be reluctant to wear one. If everyone is required to wear masks, the sick automatically have one on and there is no stigma attached.\n",
      "Also, experts emphasized, Americans should be taught to take seriously admonitions to stop shaking hands and hugging. The “W.H.O. elbow bump” may look funny, but it’s a legitimate technique for preventing infection.\n",
      "“In Asia, where they went through SARS, people understand the danger,” Dr. Heymann said. “It’s instilled in the population that you’ve got to do the right thing.”\n",
      "Federal intervention is necessary for some vital aspects of life during a pandemic.\n",
      "Only the federal government can enforce interstate commerce laws to ensure that food, water, electricity, gas, phone lines and other basic needs keep flowing across state lines to cities and suburbs.\n",
      "Mr. Trump has said he could compel companies to prioritize making ventilators, masks and other needed goods. Some have volunteered; the Hanes underwear company, for example, will use its cotton to make masks for hospital workers.\n",
      "He also has the military; the Navy is committing two hospital ships to the fight. And Mr. Trump can call up the National Guard. As of Saturday evening, more than 6,500 National Guard members already are assisting in the coronavirus response in 38 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.\n",
      "High-level decisions like these must be made quickly, experts said.\n",
      "“Many Western political leaders are behaving as though they are on a tightrope,” said Dr. David Nabarro, a W.H.O. special envoy on Covid-19 and a veteran of fights against SARS, Ebola and cholera.\n",
      "“But there is no choice. We must do all in our power to fight this,” he added. “I sense that most people — and certainly those in business — get it. They would prefer to take the bitter medicine at once and contain outbreaks as they start rather than gamble with uncertainty.”\n",
      "The roughly 175,000 ventilators in all American hospitals and the national stockpile are expected to be far fewer than are needed to handle a surge of patients desperate for breath.\n",
      "The machines pump air and oxygen into the lungs, but they normally cost $25,000 or more each, and neither individual hospitals nor the federal emergency stockpile has ever had enough on hand to handle the number of pneumonia patients that this pandemic is expected to produce.\n",
      "New York, for example, has found about 6,000 ventilators for purchase around the world, Governor Cuomo said. He estimated the state would need about 30,000.\n",
      "The manufacturers, including a dozen in the United States, say there is no easy way to ramp up production quickly. But it is possible other manufacturers, including aerospace and automobile companies, could be enlisted to do so.\n",
      "Ventilators are basically air pumps with motors controlled by circuits that make them act like lungs: the pump pushes air into the patient, then stops so the weight of the chest can push the air back out.\n",
      "Automobiles and airplanes contain many small pumps, like those for oil, water and air-conditioning fluid, that might be modified to act as basic, stripped-down ventilators. On Sunday, Mr. Trump tweeted that Ford and General Motors had been “given the go-ahead” to produce ventilators.\n",
      "Providers, meanwhile, are scrambling for alternatives.\n",
      "Canadian nurses are disseminating a 2006 paper describing how one ventilator can be modified to treat four patients simultaneously. Inventors have proposed combining C-PAP machines, which many apnea sufferers own, and oxygen tanks to improvise a ventilator.\n",
      "The United States must also work to increase its supply of piped and tanked oxygen, Dr. Aylward said.\n",
      "One of the lessons of China, he noted, was that many Covid-19 patients who would normally have been intubated and on ventilators managed to survive with oxygen alone.\n",
      "Hospitals in the United States have taken some measures to handle surges of patients, such as stopping elective surgery and setting up isolation rooms.\n",
      "To protect bedridden long-term patients, nursing homes and hospitals also should immediately stop admitting visitors and do constant health checks on their staffs, said Dr. James LeDuc, director of the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch.\n",
      "The national stockpile does contain some prepackaged military field hospitals, but they are not expected to be nearly enough for a big surge.\n",
      "In Wuhan, the Chinese government famously built two new hospitals in two weeks. All other hospitals were divided: 48 were designated to handle 10,000 serious or critical coronavirus patients, while others were restricted to handling emergencies like heart attacks and births.\n",
      "Wherever that was impractical, hospitals were divided into “clean” and “dirty” zones, and the medical teams did not cross over. Walls to isolate whole wards were built, and — as in Ebola wards — doctors went in one end of the room wearing protective gear and left by the other end, where they de-gowned under the eyes of a nurse to prevent infection.\n",
      "As of Saturday, schools in 45 states were closed entirely, but that is a decision that divided experts.\n",
      "“Closing all schools may not make sense unless there is documented widespread community transmission, which we’re not seeing in most of the country,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former C.D.C. director under President Barack Obama.\n",
      "It is unclear how much children spread coronavirus. They very seldom get sick enough to be hospitalized, which is not true of flu. Current testing cannot tell whether most do not even become infected.\n",
      "In China, Dr. Aylward said, he asked all of the doctors he spoke to whether they had seen any family clusters in which a child was the first to be infected. No one had, he said, which astonished him.\n",
      "That leaves a quandary. Closing schools is a normal part of social distancing; after all, schools are the workplaces for many adults, too. And when the disease is clearly spreading within an individual school, it must close.\n",
      "But closing whole school districts can seriously disrupt a city’s ability to fight an outbreak. With their children stuck at home, nurses, doctors, police officers and other emergency medical workers cannot come to work.\n",
      "Also, many children in low-income families depend on the meals they eat at schools.\n",
      "Cities that close all schools are creating special “hub schools” for the children of essential workers. In Ohio, the governor has told school bus drivers to deliver hot meals to children who normally got them at school.\n",
      "China’s effort succeeded, experts said, in part because of hundreds of thousands of volunteers. The government declared a “people’s war” and rolled out a “Fight On, Wuhan! Fight On, China!” campaign.\n",
      "It made inspirational films that combined airline ads with 1940s-style wartime propaganda. The ads were somewhat corny, but they rallied the public.\n",
      "Many people idled by the lockdowns stepped up to act as fever checkers, contact tracers, hospital construction workers, food deliverers, even babysitters for the children of first responders, or as crematory workers.\n",
      "With training, volunteers were able to do some ground-level but crucial medical tasks, such as basic nursing, lab technician work or making sure that hospital rooms were correctly decontaminated.\n",
      "Americans often step forward to help neighbors affected by hurricanes and floods; many will no doubt do so in this outbreak, but they will need training in how not to fall ill and add to the problem.\n",
      "“In my experience, success is dependent on how much the public is informed and participates,” Admiral Ziemer said. “This truly is an ‘all hands on deck’ situation.”\n",
      "Clinicians in China, Italy and France have thrown virtually everything they had in hospital pharmacies into the fight, and at least two possibilities have emerged that might save patients: the anti-malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and the antiviral remdesivir, which has no licensed use.\n",
      "There is not proof yet that any of these are effective against the virus. China registered more than 200 clinical trials, including several involving those treatments, but investigators ran out of patients in critical condition to enroll. Italy and France have trials underway, and hospitals in New York are writing trial protocols now.\n",
      "One worry for trial leaders is that chloroquine has been given so much publicity that patients may refuse to be “randomized” and accept a 50 percent chance of being given a placebo.\n",
      "If any drug works on critical cases, it might be possible to use small doses as a prophylactic to prevent infection.\n",
      "An alternative is to harvest protective antibodies from the blood of people who have survived the illness, said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\n",
      "The purified blood serum — called immunoglobulin — could possibly be used in small amounts to protect emergency medical workers, too.\n",
      "“Unfortunately, the first wave won’t benefit from this,” Dr. Hotez said. “We need to wait until we have enough survivors.”\n",
      "The ultimate hope is to have a vaccine that will protect everyone, and many companies and governments have already rushed the design of candidate vaccines. But as Dr. Fauci has explained multiple times, testing those candidate vaccines for safety and effectiveness takes time.\n",
      "The process will take at least a year, even if nothing goes wrong. The roadblock, vaccine experts explained, is not bureaucratic. It is that the human immune system takes weeks to produce antibodies, and some dangerous side effects can take weeks to appear.\n",
      "After extensive animal testing, vaccines are normally given to about 50 healthy human volunteers to see if they cause any unexpected side effects and to measure what dose produces enough antibodies to be considered protective.\n",
      "If that goes well, the trial enrolls hundreds or thousands of volunteers in an area where the virus is circulating. Half get the vaccine, the rest do not — and the investigators wait. If the vaccinated half do not get the disease, the green light for production is finally given.\n",
      "In the past, some experimental vaccines have produced serious side effects, like Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can paralyze and kill. A greater danger, experts said, is that some experimental vaccines, paradoxically, cause “immune enhancement,” meaning they make it more likely, not less, that recipients will get a disease. That would be a disaster.\n",
      "One candidate coronavirus vaccine Dr. Hotez invented 10 years ago in the wake of SARS, he said, had to be abandoned when it appeared to make mice more likely to die from pneumonia when they were experimentally infected with the virus.\n",
      "In theory, the testing process could be sped up with “challenge trials,” in which healthy volunteers get the vaccine and then are deliberately infected. But that is ethically fraught when there is no cure for Covid-19. Even some healthy young people have died from this virus.\n",
      "Wealthy nations need to remember that, as much as they are struggling with the virus, poorer countries will have a far harder time and need help.\n",
      "Also, the Asian nations that have contained the virus could offer expertise — and desperately needed equipment. Jack Ma, the billionaire founder of Alibaba, recently offered large shipments of masks and testing kits to the United States.\n",
      "Wealthy nations ignored the daily warnings from Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.’s director general, that far more aggressive efforts at isolation and contact tracing were urgently needed to stop the virus.\n",
      "“Middle income and poorer nations are following the advice of international organizations while the most advanced nations find it so hard to implement it,” Dr. Nabarro said. “That must change.”\n",
      "In declaring the coronavirus a pandemic, Dr. Tedros called for countries to learn from one another’s successes, act with unity and help protect one another against a threat to people of every nationality.\n",
      "“Let’s all look out for each other,” he said.\n"

      "제목 : 'It was going for my throat': Florida python hunters wrestle invasive snakes\n",
      "본문 : \n",
      " OCHOPEE, Fla. (Reuters) - Thomas Aycock’s life flashed before his eyes one night in the Everglades as a 13-foot Burmese python squeezed his arm and a leg in its coils.  Aycock, who was trying to bag the snake by himself, still recalls feeling its tail across his back. “I knew what it was doing, it was going for my throat,” said the 54-year-old Florida Army National Guard major who was able to wrestle free during that incident in the summer of 2018. “I said to myself, ‘It can’t go down like this.’” That scare has not stopped him from returning again and again to the sprawling wetland, devoting almost every spare moment to searching the thick brush and sawgrass for more snakes, as he was doing during this interview.   The state encourages hunters to capture or kill the giant, invasive south Asian snakes that are decimating local wildlife.  Dozens of hunters are prowling the Everglades during Florida’s 10-day Python Bowl, which ends Monday.  Armed with long metal hooks that resemble fireplace pokers and bags, many hunters catch the snakes and take them in live.  Those who take the most longest and heaviest pythons each will win $2,000 in cash.  Other prizes include off-road vehicles. Aycock and his fellow hunters are spending days and nights slowly creeping across the webs of levees that span the Everglades by foot, bicycle and souped-up SUV looking for the glint of an eye or the shine of brown and black scales. First found in the Everglades around the year 2000, the snakes were introduced by pet owners and possibly a snake research facility that was destroyed when Hurricane Andrew struck the region in 1992.  Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission staff bag an invasive Burmese python in the Everglades Wildlife Management Area, Florida June 23, 2019. FWC/Alicia Wellman/Handout via REUTERSThe behemoths, some of which measure more than 18 feet (5.5 m) long and weigh more than 100 pounds (45 kg), have wreaked havoc on the fragile ecosystem. A 2012 study in Everglades National Park by the United States Geological Survey found 99% fewer raccoons, 98% fewer opossums and 87% fewer bobcats. Massive snakes have even been found trying to eat alligators.  “I saw an opossum last night out on the levee and it was the first small animal I’ve seen in probably five or six months,” Aycock said. Agencies including the South Florida Water Management District and the Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission have all launched python removal programs in recent years, offering hunters hourly wages and bonuses depending on the size and weight.  According to a 2019 report, contracted python hunters brought in about 1,900 snakes since the program launched in March 2017. The success has been hard fought.  Despite their size and numbers, which some estimate in the hundreds of thousands, Aycock said it can take eight hours on average to find a snake. HUNDREDS CAUGHT From the start of the program to mid-2018, the most current data available, hunters working for both agencies spent 14,000 hours in the field yielding 1,186 snakes.  Some larger females have been found holding up to 100 eggs.  “We’re targeting removal in bird rookeries, in sensitive ecological areas, so regardless of the snakes’ population we know every one removed makes a difference,” said Kristen Sommers, the state’s wildlife impact management section leader. Yet on Wednesday night, finding even one proved impossible for Aycock.  Slideshow (10 Images)The cooler weather meant the cold-blooded serpents stayed hidden and out of sight. “Every python removed out of this ecosystem serves a purpose in restoring this ecosystem,” Aycock said. “We have a good time out here, but it’s also a mission we take seriously and are willing to work at.” Editing by Scott Malone and David GregorioOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n"

REUTERS/Simon Dawson   LONDON (Reuters) - Monty Python fans, sporting knotted handkerchiefs on their heads, rolled up trousers and Wellington boots, gathered in London on Saturday for a suitably silly celebration of the 50th anniversary of the comedy troupe.

      "본문 : \n",
      " LONDON (Reuters) - Terry Jones, one of the British Monty Python comedy team and director of religious satire “Life of Brian”, has died at the age of 77 after a long battle with dementia, his family said on Wednesday. Born in Wales in 1942, Jones was also an author, historian and poet. He had been diagnosed in 2015 with a rare form of dementia, FTD. Jones was one of the creators of Monty Python’s Flying Circus, the British TV show that rewrote the rules of comedy with surreal sketches, characters and catchphrases, in 1969. He co-directed the team’s first film “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” with fellow Python Terry Gilliam, and directed the subsequent Life of Brian and “The Meaning of Life.” Python Michael Palin, who met Jones at Oxford University, said he was “kind, generous, supportive and passionate about living life to the full”. “He was far more than one of the funniest writer-performers of his generation, he was the complete Renaissance comedian - writer, director, presenter, historian, brilliant children’s author, and the warmest, most wonderful company you could wish to have.” Jones’ family said his work with Monty Python, books, films, television programmes, poems and other work “will live on forever, a fitting legacy to a true polymath”. Jones wrote comedy sketches with Palin in the 1960s for shows including “The Frost Report” and “Do Not Adjust Your Set” before the pair teamed up with Cambridge graduates Eric Idle, John Cleese, Graham Chapman - who died in 1989 - and U.S. film-maker Terry Gilliam to create Monty Python. One of Jones’ best-known roles was that of Brian’s mother in Life of Brian released in 1979, who screeches at worshippers from an open window: “He’s not the Messiah, he’s a very naughty boy”.

      " LONDON (Reuters) - Terry Jones, one of the British Monty Python comedy team and director of religious satire “Life of Brian”, has died at the age of 77 after a long battle with dementia, his family said on Wednesday. Born in Wales in 1942, Jones was also an author, historian and poet. He had been diagnosed in 2015 with a rare form of dementia, FTD. Jones was one of the creators of Monty Python’s Flying Circus, the British TV show that rewrote the rules of comedy with surreal sketches, characters and catchphrases, in 1969.

      "본문 : \n",
      " BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A Brussels puppet theater as old as Belgium itself is staging its Christmas nativity show this year with a dash of Monty Python humor added to the traditional story of Jesus’s birth. Puppeteers rehearse Christmas nativity show at the Royal Toone Theatre in central Brussels, Belgium December 19, 2019.   REUTERS/Francois Lenoir“It’s like a parody, a little bit like Monty Python’s Life of Brian. We don’t mean to be disrespectful, but...it’s not the Bible, really,” said Nicolas Geal, director of the Royal Theater Toone in the Belgian capital. “I don’t know whether I will go to heaven or hell for playing this,” he added with a smile.  Life of Brian, a 1979 film written by Britain’s Monty Python comedy group, is the satirical tale of a Jewish man born on the same day and next door to Jesus, and later mistaken for the Messiah. It drew protests over alleged blasphemy at the time. Playing off the film, the puppet theater’s nativity tale features silly foreign accents, particularly from the Three Wise Men, lots of jokes and slang often with a local flavor.  The theater was formed in 1830, the year Belgium was founded. Geal, who dubs himself Toone VIII, succeeded his father, who moved the theater to its current site in an alleyway near Brussels’ regal Grand Place in the 1960s.  Now boasting 1,400 puppets including some dating to the 19th century, the theater has put on shows ranging from Carmen to Cyrano de Bergerac, Dracula and Hamlet, geared more to an adult than child audience.  Geal said the European tradition of puppet shows dates back to the Middle Ages when the church forbade people to perform nativity scenes themselves, prompting performers to use puppets.  Toone’s marionettes, with a rod attached to the head, are like those used in Sicily where this form of puppet theater is thought to have originated, but given a Belgian twist. “What’s typical of Belgium is the fact I believe that we don’t take ourselves too seriously. Then we have this kind of surrealism,” Geal said. Brussels once had as many as 50 puppet theaters, Geal said, but almost all folded as other forms of entertainment became popular, particularly television, with only the Toone surviving.

      "For decades, we have been hearing that the baby-boom generation was like a pig moving through a python–bigger than the generations before and after. \n",
      "That’s true. But that’s also a very misleading metaphor for understanding the demographic forces that are driving up federal spending: They aren’t temporary. The generation born between 1946 and 1964 is the beginning of a demographic transition that will persist for decades after the baby boomers die, the consequence of lengthening lifespans and declining fertility. Putting the federal budget on a sustainable course requires long-lasting fixes, not short-lived tweaks.  \n",
      "First, a few demographic facts.\n",
      "As the chart below illustrates, there was a surge in births in the U.S. at the end of World War II, a subsequent decline, and then an uptick as baby boomers began having children.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the population has been rising, the number of births in the U.S. the past few years has been below the peak baby-boom levels, possibly because many couples chose not to have children during bad economic times. More significant, fertility rates–roughly the number of babies born per woman during her lifetime–have fallen well below pre-baby-boom levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Americans are living longer. In 1950, a man who made it to age 65 could expect to live until 78 and a woman until 81. Social Security’s actuaries project that a man who lived to age 65 in 2010 will reach 84 and a woman age 86.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Put all this together, and it’s clear that a growing fraction of the U.S. population will be 65 or older.   \n",
      "The combination of longer life spans and lower fertility rates means the ratio of elderly (over 65) to working-age population (ages 20 to 64) is rising. As the chart below illustrates, the ratio will rise steadily as more baby boomers reach retirement age–and then it levels off.  \n",

Artificial intelligence (AI) will, for the foreseeable future, have a significant disruptive impact on jobs. That said, this disruption can create new opportunities if policymakers choose to harness them—including some with the potential to help address long-standing social inequities.

      "AI’s disruption presents a clear challenge: competition to traditional skilled workers arising from the cross-relevance of data scientists and code engineers, who can adapt quickly to new contexts. Data analytics has become an indispensable feature of successful companies across all industries. This reality dictates that companies invest heavily in data analytics to remain competitive and profitable. Consequently, unlikely industries such as retail, banking, finance, and even agricultural firms are aggressively competing for talent with specific computational data science and programming skills. A recent IBM report expertly quantifies the scope and breadth of employers’ hiring demands, noting that “[d]emand for data-driven decision makers, such as data-enabled marketing managers, will comprise one-third of the data savvy professional job market, with a projected increase of 110,000 positions by 2020.” Herein lies a window of opportunity: the rapidly growing technical skills gap.\n",
      "Investing in high-quality education and training programs is one way that policymakers proactively attempt to address the workforce challenges presented by artificial intelligence. It is essential that we make affirmative, inclusive choices to ensure that marginalized communities participate equitably in these opportunities.\n",
      "Policymakers should prioritize understanding the demographics of those most likely to lose jobs in the short-run. As opposed to obsessively assembling case studies, we need to proactively identify policy entrepreneurs who can conceive of training policies that equip workers with technical skills of “long-game” relevance. As IBM points out, “[d]ata democratization impacts every career path, so academia must strive to make data literacy an option, if not a requirement, for every student in any field of study.”\n",
      "Machines are an equal opportunity displacer, blind to color and socioeconomic status.\n",
      "Machines are an equal opportunity displacer, blind to color and socioeconomic status. Effective policy responses require collaborative data collection and coordination among key stakeholders—policymakers, employers, and educational institutions—to  identify at-risk worker groups and to inform workforce development strategies. Machine substitution is purely an efficiency game in which workers overwhelmingly lose. Nevertheless, we can blunt these effects by identifying critical leverage points.\n",
      "Investing in innovative education and training is an excellent place to start. Bill Gates’ recent $1.7 billion investment in U.S. public schools is a sign of the way forward, which offers two compelling messages for policymakers. First, innovate and experiment until we identify the right policies. Second, prioritize high-needs schools in poor neighborhoods; they deserve distinct attention to close their opportunity gaps and prepare them to be competitive in the future workforce.\n",
      "Policymakers can choose to harness AI’s disruptive power to address workforce challenges and redesign fair access to opportunity simultaneously. We should train our collective energies on identifying practical policies that update our current agrarian-based education model, which unfairly disadvantages children from economically segregated neighborhoods. Evidence from a Harvard and New York University research study suggests attending a high-quality high school increases a student’s chances of attending a four-year college; which by extension improves their future income earning potential.\n",
      "Let me ask a bold question: how much do we lose if we experiment with substituting an entry-level data science class for machine shop or a vocational carpentry program in urban high schools and community colleges? A 2010 pilot partnership between the University of California, Los Angeles and the National Science Foundation is an encouraging sign; the pilot focuses on redesigning computer science curricula in urban high schools to include newer mobile technologies and computational analysis.\n",

      "To figure this out, I analyzed a database of 29 million job vacancies advertised online during 2013 as compiled by the analytics firm Burning Glass. Of these, roughly 1.4 million were for software application developers, making it the most in-demand occupation. In total, 3 million ads also contained salary information, which I could use to estimate the average value of each distinct skill advertised. \n",

      " \n",
      "For example, 8.4 percent of ads for software developers in San Jose requested Java, a widely used programming language, associated with an average salary of $98,000 across all U.S. ads mentioning both it and a salary requirement. Yet, for the United States as a whole, just 5.7 percent of software developer ads required Java. In New York City, the share was 6.7, and it was 4.7 in Louisville.\n",

      "Other high-value programming languages and skills were disproportionately advertised in San Jose, such as Linux, C++, Python and the term “software engineering.”  These skills were much less commonly required for jobs in Louisville and even New York. Only 0.2 percent of software jobs required Python in Louisville and 1.7 in New York City, compared to 2.8 percent in San Jose. It is valued at $100,345.\n",

      "본문 : \n",
      " \n",
      "Public policy and public affairs schools aim to train competent creators and implementers of government policy. While drawing on the principles that gird our economic and political systems to provide a well-rounded education, like law schools and business schools, policy schools provide professional training. They are quite distinct from graduate programs in political science or economics which aim to train the next generation of academics. As professional training programs, they add value by imparting both the skills which are relevant to current employers, and skills which we know will be relevant as organizations and societies evolve. \n",
      "The relevance of the skills that policy programs impart to address problems of today and tomorrow bears further discussion. We are living through an era in which societies are increasingly interconnected. The wide-scale adoption of devices such as the smartphone is having a profound impact on our culture, communities, and economy. The use of social and digital media and associated means of communication enabled by mobile devices is changing the tone, content, and geographic scope of our conversations, modifying how information is generated and consumed, and changing the very nature of citizen engagement. \n",
      "Information technology-based platforms provisioned by private providers such as Facebook, Google, Uber, and Lyft maintain information about millions of citizens and enable services such as transportation that were mediated in the past solely by the public sector. Surveillance for purposes of public safety via large-scale deployment of sensors also raises fundamental questions about information privacy. From technology-enabled global delivery of work to displacement and replacement of categories of work, some studies estimate that up to 47 percent of U.S. employment might be at risk of computerization with an attendant rise in income inequality. These technology-induced changes will affect every policy domain. How should policy programs best prepare students to address societal challenges in this world that is being transformed by technology? We believe the answer lies in educating students to be “men and women of intelligent action.” \n",
      "A model of policy education\n",
      "We begin with a skills-based model of policy education. These four essential skills address the general problems policy practitioners frequently face:\n",
      "\n",
      "Design skills to craft policy ideas \n",
      "Analytical skills to make smart ex ante decisions \n",
      "Interpersonal experience to manage policy implementation  \n",
      "Evaluative skills to assess outcomes ex post and correct course if necessary\n",
      "\n",
      "These skills make up the policy analysis toolkit required to be data driven practitioner of “intelligent action” in any policy domain. This toolkit needs to be supplemented by an understanding of how technology is transforming societal challenges, enabling new solutions, or disrupting existing regulatory regimes. This understanding is essential to policy formulation and implementation. \n",
      "Pillar 1: Design skills\n",
      "As with engineering, where design precedes analysis, this first pillar seeks to educate students in thinking creatively about problems in order to devise and develop policy ideas. Using ideas derived from design, divergent and convergent thinking principles are employed to generate, explore, and arrive at a candidate set of solutions. Using Uber as an example, an approach to identify and explore the key policy issues such as convenience, costs, driver working hours, and insurance would involve interviewing and observing both incumbent taxi drivers and Uber drivers. This in turn would lead to a set of alternatives that deserve further and careful consideration.  Using these skills, candidate designs and choices that are generated can be evaluated using the policy analytic toolkit. \n",
      "Pillar 2: Analytical skills\n",
      "At Carnegie Mellon, we are often cited in media and interrogated by peers on our approach to analytical and technology skills education. Curiosity about which skills are the “right” skills to teach policy practitioners are common, but we believe this is the wrong approach. We instead begin from the premise that policy or management decisions should be grounded in evidence.  We then determine the skills required to assemble the types of evidence that will likely be available to policy makers in the future.  In increasingly instrumented environments where citizens and infrastructure produce continuous streams of data, making sense of it all will require a somewhat different set of skills. We believe that a grounding in micro-economics, operations research, statistics, and program evaluation (aka causal inference) to be an essential core to policy programs. \n",
      "New coursework will teach students to work with multi-variable data and machine learning with an emphasis on prediction. This material ought to be part of the required coursework in statistics given the importance of prediction in many policy implementation settings. Along the same lines, the ability to work with unstructured data (especially text) and data visualization will become increasingly relevant to all students, not just those students who want to specialize in data analytics. Finally, knowledge of data manipulation and analysis languages such as Python and R for analytic work will be important because data often has to be massaged and cleansed prior to analysis. An important task for programs will be to determine the competencies expected of graduates. \n",
      "Pillar 3: Interpersonal experiences\n",
      "The third pillar of the skills-based model is interpersonal experience, where the practiced habits of good communication and steady negotiation developed with a sound understanding of organizations, their design and their behaviors. We label these purposely as experiences rather than skills because we believe they are best practiced either in the real-world or in simulated real-world settings. It is also in this pillar where practitioners learn the knowledge necessary to become credible experts in their domain. We believe that in addition to core coursework in the area, a supplementary curriculum which provides students with opportunities to gain these experiences is an essential component of our educational model.\n",

      "The ability to carefully diagnose the effectiveness of policy or management interventions is the fourth pillar of our model. It is insufficient to create and execute policy without measurement, and this is where both careful thought to the fundamental issues of measurement and evaluation become important. The ability to make objective judgments on the benefits, liabilities, and unintended consequences of prior policies is the goal of this set of skills. Here, sound statistical and econometric training with an understanding of the principles of causal inference is essential. In addition, program evaluation skills such as cost-benefit and financial analysis help practitioners round out their evaluation skills by considering both non-monetary and economic impacts.\n",
      "What should be retired?\n",
      "A skills-based approach might replace certain aspects of existing policy training.  This depends on a number of factors specific to each institution, but three generally applicable observations are clear. First, real-world experiences are a powerful way to encode domain learning as well as project management skills. Through project-based work, students can learn about institutional contexts in specific policy domains and political processes such as budgeting. Second, team-based projects allow students to learn and apply principles of management and organizational behavior. At Carnegie Mellon, we refer to these as “systems synthesis” projects, since they require students to adopt a systemic point of view and to synthesize a number of skills in their policy analysis toolkit. Third, interpersonal skills training can be practiced through activities such as weekend negotiation exercises, hackathons, and speaker series. These activities can be highly intentional and fashioned to reinforce skills rather than as a recess from the “real work” of classroom training. Since students complete graduate programs in such a short time, counseling them to focus on outcomes from day one will allow them to choose a reinforcing set of coursework and real-world experiences. \n",
      "In summary, we argue for a model of policy education that views practitioners as future problem solvers. Good policy education must consider the ways in which problems will present themselves, and the ways in which answers will obscure themselves. Rigorous training grounded in the analysis of available evidence and buoyed by real-world interpersonal experiences is a sound approach to relevant, durable policy training.\n",

      "Amidst growing frustration with the cost of higher education, complaints also abound about its quality. One critique, launched in the book Academically Adrift by two sociologists, finds little evidence that college students score better on measures of critical thinking, writing, and reasoning after attending college. This is something of a paradox, since strong evidence shows that attending college tends to raise earnings power, even for students who start with mediocre preparation. \n",
      "Our recent study uses a different approach to assess the value of a college education. We find that the particular skills listed by a college’s alumni on their resumes predict how well graduates from those schools perform in terms of earning a living, meeting debt obligations, and working for high-paying or innovative companies. Since jobs requiring more valuable skills typically require at least some college education, this finding suggests many students are gaining valuable skills from college. But the variation in alumni skills across schools is wide, even after considering the aptitude of the students in terms of their pre-admission test scores. This variation implies that what one studies and where have big effects on economic outcomes.\n",

      "Skills versus degrees\n",
      "\n",
      "It is widely known that education raises individual earnings, but education—measured in years of study or level of degree—is a very rough measure of learning. Thus, it is not surprising that studies consistently find that skills are an important predictor of economic outcomes. People with higher test scores—another measure of learning—earn higher wages, even with the same level of education. Likewise, graduates with technical degrees earn more, as do workers in occupations requiring more STEM skills. At the international scale, performance on standardized exams has a much stronger statistical relationship with economic outcomes than do years of education, according to a new OECD study.\n",

      "Using data from the company Burning Glass, we calculated the average salary listed for distinct skills based on 3 million job vacancy ads. To match these skills to colleges, we used data from LinkedIn’s college profile pages, which show the 25 most common skills (e.g., customer service, Microsoft Excel, Python) listed by alumni from each college. For the average college, we observed 1,150 profiles per skill. (A great advantage of using LinkedIn data is the large sample size.) We obtained data for 2,164 colleges representing profiles for 2.5 million U.S. residents who attended college. By comparison, Academically Adrift surveyed 2,300 college graduates.\n",

      "\n",
      "Measured at mid-career (meaning at least 10 years of working), salaries tend to be much higher for alumni who list high-value skills on their resumes. Earnings go up by an average of $2,600 for every decile of skill. Our more detailed empirical work shows that skills predict higher earnings even after controlling for math test scores on the ACT and SAT, as well as other student characteristics like family income.\n",
      "Cal Tech graduates list the highest-value skills (e.g., Matlab, Python, C++, algorithms, and machine learning) and typically earn $126,000 at mid-career. Other four-year schools with high-value skills and high salaries include Harvey Mudd, MIT, the Polytechnic Institute of New York University, and the Air Force Academy. \n",
      "Earnings data from two-year colleges are not as widely available, and the correlation with alumni skills is weaker, but alumni from those schools also seem to benefit from higher skills training.

Here too, more valuable skills translate into labor market success. For example, not a single Harvey Mudd attendee between 2009 and 2011 defaulted on his or her federal loans within three years of leaving. Repayment rates average 95 percent for four-year colleges in the top 10 percent for alumni skills but 87 percent for those in the bottom 10 percent.

A total of 212 employers, including government agencies, made it onto a top 100 list for at least one group of student majors.

Colleges that specialize in this training or instill even moderately valuable skills in the least academically prepared students may be socially important institutions even if their alumni frequently are less affluent.\n",
      "Nonetheless, earnings clearly matter privately and socially, as does work that supports innovation and highly productive advanced industries. Many colleges offer programs of study in fields that appear to have almost no market value—nor even any social value since the knowledge acquired is never put to use, at least through paid employment. In this sense, how well colleges instill highly valuable skills and prepare students to contribute productively to the economy should be an important consideration when evaluating schools. Colleges that do this for the students least likely to otherwise succeed are offering an even more beneficial service, as we have discussed in our value-added college research.\n",

      "While the world is fixated on Iraq and the Middle East, North Korea continues to pose at least as great a threat to Western security interests. Six-party talks with the North Koreans in Beijing have just showed that the Bush administration hasn’t yet found a way out of the nuclear crisis. Although negotiations appear likely to resume in a couple of months, their prospects for success seem poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic dilemma is easy to understand. North Korea will not surrender its nuclear capabilities, which are among its only valuable national assets, unless offered a very good deal for giving them up. President Bush refuses to offer such a deal because he sees the North Korean demand as blackmail. He insists that before any talks about better diplomatic relations or economic interaction occur, North Korea first relinquish—with verification—a nuclear program it had pledged nine years ago to abandon completely. At most, Bush may, as an interim gesture, offer to sign a multilateral accord in which all six parties (the two Koreas, the United States, China, Japan and Russia) pledge not to attack each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, in fits and starts North Korea continues its gradual progress toward a larger nuclear capability. Given the regime’s desperate economic straits, its erratic and eccentric and isolated regime and its threats last April that it might even export nuclear materials if circumstances got bad enough, this is extremely bad news.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the extent the Bush administration has a plan for addressing this crisis, it is a strategy of pressure. It insisted on the six-party negotiating format because that allows the other five parties all to insist that North Korea de-nuclearize. That kind of setting also deprives North Korea of its bluster and brinkmanship tactics.\n",

      "For example, when the delegation from Pyongyang used the recent Beijing meeting to accuse the Bush administration of harboring aggressive designs on North Korea, Russia countered that it was confident the United States had no such intention. The Bush administration also has established a creative concept known as the proliferation security initiative, by which countries such as the United States, Japan, Australia, France and Germany make use of existing national laws to inspect North Korean ships in their waters—complicating North Korea’s efforts to smuggle illicit weapons, drugs and counterfeit currency.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the military card is still on the table in principle as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Bush administration’s strategy is unlikely to work. Faced with gradual economic strangulation, North Korea’s stubborn and spiteful regime would probably again let its people starve—and perhaps consider selling dangerous weapons to terrorists—before crying uncle. Moreover, China, South Korea and Japan are far from ready to apply such a “python strategy.” China publicly criticized the United States for having an inflexible stance in last month’s talks.\n",

      "Japan and South Korea both insisted on presenting a more conciliatory package of incentives to North Korea in Beijing than Washington was prepared to countenance. And none of our three key regional partners has any interest whatever in a military option at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Faced with this dilemma, we need to think bigger. We must offer much more to North Korea but demand far more in return. The goal should be to push North Korea, which has shown increasing interest in economic reform, to seriously attempt such reform—building on the precedents offered by China and Vietnam in the past two decades. If North Korea is willing and takes steps, such as cutting its conventional military forces, that are needed to give such a plan any hope of success, we can be generous in return. This would not be giving in to blackmail; it would be a form of assisted suicide for the Stalinist ways of the North Korean regime. Even if Kim Jong Il and his cronies survived the transition, their rule would be radically transformed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This plan would require the help of all six parties that are now part of the negotiating process. Chinese economists and technicians would teach the North Koreans how to carry out market reforms. Russia would reassure Kim Jong Il and his military commanders that intrusive arms control verification can be done without opening up the country to attack. Japan and South Korea would provide aid and investment; South Korea would also have to make at least modest cuts in its conventional forces in return for much deeper cuts in the oversized North Korean military.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the nuclear and conventional military issues, North Korea would also agree to verifiable elimination of its chemical weapons and ballistic missiles. It would cease counterfeiting and drug trafficking. It would have to let all Japanese kidnapping victims leave and begin a human rights dialogue with the outside world. It would continue to abstain from terrorism and provocative actions against its neighbors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States would, for its part, ease trade sanctions immediately and ultimately lift them. It would, together with its regional partners and international financial institutions, provide at least $2 billion a year in aid to North Korea. The aid would not be in the form of cash (or new nuclear reactors), and would not be provided in one big dose but would be disbursed incrementally—while we watched to make sure North Korea was also holding up its end of the grand bargain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diplomatic ties and security assurances leading to a full peace treaty would also be appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, this approach might well fail. North Korean leaders may, for example, believe they need nuclear weapons to deter the Bush administration from another preemptive action against another charter member of the axis of evil. But it would be a major mistake to act on that assumption before testing it. And if we try and fail, coercive policies may then become possible, as our regional partners will have a much harder time claiming that diplomacy has not yet been seriously attempted.\n",

      " \n",
      "America’s urban landscape is changing. The familiar distinctions between central cities and suburbs and between the growing Sunbelt and the more stagnant Frostbelt parts of the country are being complicated by new demographic trends, two in particular. The first trend is the sharp rise in immigration to the United States. Each year about one million people, predominantly Latin American and Asian in origin, arrive in the United States, most settling in urban areas. The second trend involves the baby-boomers. This large cohort of 76 million people?often termed “the pig in the python”?is now aging toward the tail of that python. Most boomers will not move but “age in place”?in the suburbs rather than in the city. Both these trends will have important effects on urban America.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the “White-Black, City-Suburb” Typology \n",
      "For much of the postwar period, discussions of race and space in urban America revolved around black migration to central cities and “white flight” to the suburbs. The new immigration that is infusing many urban areas with new residents from a variety of backgrounds suggests the need for a new way of thinking about the demographic profiles of cities and suburbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact of immigration is apparent from a glance at the central counties (those that contain a metropolitan area’s central-city population) showing greatest population gains during 1990?99. The two largest gainers, Maricopa County, home of Phoenix, and Clark County, home of Las Vegas, achieved most of their gains from domestic migration?migrants from other parts of the United States. Yet each of the next five central counties with the greatest population gains?those of the Los Angeles, Houston, San Diego, Miami, and Dallas metropolitan areas?registered a net loss of domestic migrants. Their gains came entirely from international migration and natural increase. Were it not for immigration, the population of these areas, and of several other large central counties, would register far smaller growth or outright declines. Indeed, areas that do not attract nearly as many immigrants?the central counties of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Cleveland, and Buffalo, among others?lost population over the 1990s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because conventional city-suburb, black-white demographic profiles do not take adequate account of this new immigration, I offer a new typology of the nation’s large metropolitan areas, those with populations greater than 1 million (see table 1).\n",

      "The typology begins with a Multiethnic High Immigration category of 12 metropolitan areas with high immigration and a significant Asian or Hispanic presence. The largest of these areas are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco. Four other categories cover areas that have a primarily black minority presence and those that are mostly white; and within each, those growing at a relatively high pace and those growing only modestly. These four categories are: White-Black Fast-Growing (for example, Atlanta), White-Black Slow-Growing (Detroit), Mostly White Fast-Growing (Las Vegas), and Mostly White Slow-Growing (Pittsburgh).\n",
      "\n",
      "In metropolitan areas where white-black racial dynamics have been a historically important demographic dimension, the slow-growing areas tend to be in the Rustbelt (New Orleans being an exception), and the fast-growing areas are located in the Southeast, which has now begun to attract back significant numbers of African Americans. Mostly White Fast-Growing areas are located primarily in the West and Midwest (Orlando, Nashville, and West Palm Beach excepted). Mostly White Slow-Growing areas are located in the Northeast and Midwest (Louisville excepted).\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Table 2 gives the composite racial profiles for cities and suburbs in each of these five categories. Multiethnic High Immigration areas clearly have the greatest diversity both in their cities and in their suburbs although the suburbs remain majority white. Among the White-Black categories, the slow-growing areas show a lesser tendency toward black suburbanization.\n",
      "\n",
      "What these statistics show is that the conventional view of cities as being in decline and as having predominantly black populations fails to take into account recent changes in the urban scene. Today some of the nation’s fastest-growing cities are gaining population from domestic migration and are mostly white. And several large multiethnic metropolitan areas house “majority minorities” in their cities and may soon do so in their suburbs as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old “city-suburb” typology also fails to recognize heterogeneous growth patterns within the suburbs. Many inner and even middle suburbs are experiencing demographic dynamics similar to those of the cities. This is especially the case in some of the largest “melting pot” metropolitan areas. A look at the immigration and domestic migration dynamics for counties within the greater Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York CMSAs (Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas) shows that it is not just the inner counties whose gains are attributable solely to international migration. Of the 29 counties in the greater New York CMSA, fully 20 registered negative domestic migration during 1990?99 and achieved their only migration growth from immigration from abroad. The same goes for 4 of the 5 counties in the Los Angeles CMSA and for 7 of the 10 counties of the San Francisco CMSA.\n",
      "\n",
      "The heterogeneity of suburbs was already apparent in 1990. Figure 1 compares the Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Detroit metropolitan areas. The racially diverse suburbs of Los Angeles, with their infusion of immigrants and new ethnic minorities, contrast with the suburbs of Atlanta, which show moderate racial heterogeneity, and those of slower-growing Detroit, where historical racial antagonisms keep the divide between city and suburbs fairly sharp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suburban growth patterns continue to favor the outer suburbs. Of the 30 counties that made the fastest gains via net domestic migration during 1990?99, most that are in metropolitan areas lie in the outer suburban reaches of fast-growing metropolitan areas such as Denver, Atlanta, Las Vegas, Dallas, and Houston. Even in the fast-growing, less dense portions of the country, an outer suburban residence remains popular.\n",
      "Aging Boomers, Cities, and Suburbs\n",
      "Since the baby-boom generation began entering grade school in the 1950s, it has been followed closely by marketers, policymakers, and political consultants. But the boomers’ sharp disengagement from the residential aspects of city life seems to have escaped the notice of urban watchers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aging of the nation’s first suburban generation will increase substantially the number of households in their 50s and early 60s over the next 10 years. Early boomers?born between 1945 and 1955?will be making the transition from empty-nesters to preretirees. Many will retire from regular jobs. Some will leave their suburban homes. But most will “age in place” or perhaps make a local move.\n",
      "\n",
      "The late boomers?those born between 1955 and 1964?will still be in their prime career and prime earnings ages. Some will be looking to upgrade their housing, again in the same local area. They will have fewer children living at home than did earlier generations at the same age?and therefore more freedom in their location decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some observers have expressed the hope that these huge boomer generations might be a source for central-city revival. But the hope seems unrealistic, given the current location of this “suburban generation.” With the exception of Hispanics, baby-boomers, now in the 35-54 age groups, are less likely to reside in the city than either today’s elderly or adults now in their 20s and early 30s.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, elderly growth patterns during the 1990s show that the “graying of the suburbs” is well under way. Of the 30 counties with fastest-gaining elderly populations over the 1990s, most are either in nonmetropolitan areas or in middle or outer suburban counties of fast-growing metropolitan areas. Much of this simply reflects the aging-in-place of elderly who have moved to these fast-growing metropolitan areas during their lifetimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The projected gains in elderly over the next 25 years will occur in the Mostly White Fast-Growing and White-Black Fast-Growing areas discussed earlier. While some of this growth will be attributable to retirement migration to high amenity areas of the Mountain West and South, most will result from the aging-in-place of boomers who relocated there during their working lives or at least before retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "This suggests somewhat different patterns of growth for the new immigrant minorities than for largely white or white and black baby-boomers. Much of the boomer growth and, hence, the projected elderly gains will be in the suburbs of major metropolitan areas and in regions of the country that are not capturing new immigrant minorities. Within metropolitan areas the better-off and healthy “yuppie elderly” will tend to locate on the periphery, and the more disadvantaged segments of the older population will reside closer in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Central cities and inner suburbs in metropolitan regions that have suffered economic and demographic declines in recent decades will continue to house disproportionate numbers of the nation’s disadvantaged elderly?older elderly people, widows and widowers, female-headed households, those with incomes below or near the poverty level and relatively high levels of disability. As they continue to age in place, they will pose special challenges for local institutions that are often the most financially strapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "But although the aging of the baby-boomers will have different effects for cities and suburbs, dealing with the social services, health care, and transportation needs of a faster-growing senior population will prove a challenge to cities and suburbs alike.\n",
      "New Forces at Work\n",
      "The advent of new immigrants and the aging of the baby-boomers will surely complicate both urban and suburban race-ethnic and aging demographic dynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The demographics of Los Angeles provide just one example of how the two countervailing trends could operate. As a result of the successive outmigration of whites, juxtaposed with the continued waves of immigration of new ethnic minorities, Los Angeles County’s elderly population is still majority white, its working-aged population is only about one-third white, and its child population is predominantly Hispanic and other racial and ethnic groups. Reflecting their age, the growing racial and ethnic groups in Los Angeles will be concerned with issues of affordable housing, good schools, and neighborhoods conducive to the raising of children. And, reflecting their age, whites are likely to be more concerned with health and social support services for an aging dependent population. Whether the same kind of “racial generation gap” will occur in other melting pot metropolitan areas remains to be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever else the new urban population profiles show, the old models of dealing with cities and suburbs will need to be revised to adapt to new demographic forces in America today.\n",

      "The failure to reach agreement on production cuts at the recent OPEC+ meetings in Vienna has sent oil prices plummeting, marking a return to volatility after a reasonably calm period. This event too shows the interconnection of the world via global markets.\n",
      "The oil “war” that emerged in Vienna last week between Saudi Arabia and Russia has already affected oil companies and oilfield-services companies, as well as their employees, investors, and local communities. Many energy companies were already highly leveraged and not bringing in sufficient revenue, resulting in declines in market capitalization and jobs. However, there was still hope. That hope has severely eroded over just a week.\n",
      "This price collapse, oil market experts warn, is different than past crashes. It is a combination of a supply glut with enormous demand loss. Thus, there is no clear precedent for how it might be addressed. The breakdown of the OPEC+ talks will likely have ongoing negative implications for the cartel and its influence.\n",
      "The price collapse will also negatively influence the U.S. economy, harming not just energy companies, but also services companies and the local communities that oil revenue supports, directly and through taxes.\n",
      "Another key impact, though, is that prices for gasoline and other products made from oil will drop. Although predicting the balance of positive and negative effects on the overall economy is difficult, many voters in November will not take a holistic look at the situation. Instead, they will likely focus narrowly on how much it costs to fill up their car tanks.\n",
      "Despite the painful and empirical evidence that we live in an interconnected world, many still take this interdependence as an affront to national sovereignty. They hide within the rhetoric of populism and nationalism.\n",

      "In the energy sector, the last two secretaries of energy — Rick Perry and Dan Brouilette — used the rhetoric of freedom gas, energy dominance, and energy independence as rallying cries for their great leader and the party.\n",
      "But now, President Trump has been unable to push back the tide of the virus, nor have he or his party been able to prop up the oil markets. And so people in Texas, North Dakota, New Mexico, and Colorado have become aware of how global markets can deeply affect them, their families, and communities. Decisions made in far-away capitals have a bearing on the daily lives of Americans. The coronavirus has, perhaps, made that even clearer.\n",
      "While the shale revolution changed the global energy landscape and brought the United States a bump in geopolitical influence, becoming an energy supermajor also brings vulnerability, through greater connectivity.\n",
      "Energy dominance is nonsense, as is energy independence. “Freedom gas” was absurd from the day it was uttered. The goal, rather, should be real energy security, including resilient economics, communities, and markets. Such a security goal requires a new approach to global energy statecraft, rooted not in boisterous language, but in staid policies and regulations that acknowledge volatility in prices and inevitable geopolitical disruptions. As the energy landscape continues to change and evolve, a pivot towards resilient security will also enable a transition to a sustainable and low-carbon future.\n",
      "The volatility and uncertainty in energy markets bring an opportunity to redefine a uniquely American energy security for our multi-polar, ever-more connected world. Thus far, the administration’s response to the virus, focused on travel bans and designation of the virus as “foreign,” aren’t encouraging. But crises can also foster cooperation, and an increasingly more interconnected set of energy markets could encourage a more stable, lower-carbon future.\n",

      "본문 : \n",
      " \n",
      "Unemployment insurance (UI) is not the first policy we should be reaching for as the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health measures, implemented by governments at all levels—as well as by individuals, families, and employers—are the most important first steps. UI is not necessarily even the second type of policy to call on; the need for paid sick leave (which is both a public health measure and fiscal stimulus), robust food security policies, aid to states, targeted support for employers (especially small businesses in need of loan forbearance), and direct payments to individuals are some of the highest-priority economic measures that should be implemented immediately. \t\n",

      "\n",
      "But it is becoming increasingly clear that, even if policymakers enact some of these measures, an economic slowdown is very likely. And as that slowdown occurs, jobs will become more scarce and the unemployment rate will rise. At that point, it will be crucial that the UI system works as intended, helping workers to make ends meet even after job loss. Well-functioning, generous UI will be important not just for families, but also as a support for the broader economy and a source of timely fiscal stimulus.\n",
      "The good news is that UI has been a well-functioning automatic stabilizer in the past. The bad news is that many states have weakened their UI systems, reducing the maximum number of weeks that workers can receive benefits in a misguided effort to avoid what economists call “moral hazard,” i.e., the tendency for workers to delay job search in order to receive benefits. For example, North Carolina now only provides up to 12 weeks of insurance, far below the 26-week cap that was once the near-universal standard for states. Moreover, UI take-up has fallen over time and many states have very low UI participation in part because they have made it difficult for eligible workers to apply and/or have tightened eligibility requirements.\n",
      "This all means that the UI system has deteriorated and will function as a less-effective automatic stabilizer if actions are not taken now. What can policymakers do to bolster it? The first three reforms would help in any economic slowdown, but the final two are targeted to the nature of the current crisis.\n",
      "Mandate that states provide at least 26 weeks of regular UI benefits. Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, and South Carolina all provide too few weeks of benefits to adequately protect workers from income loss after a layoff. Returning to the traditional standard of 26 weeks is a prerequisite for a working UI system.\n",
      "Raise UI benefit levels for the duration of the economic slowdown. Emergency extensions of the number of weeks may also be called for, but they would only have substantial stabilization benefits later in a recession. More important in the short-run is to raise the average benefit level, which would immediately provide support to unemployed workers as well as fiscal stimulus. To maximize the amount of stimulus provided, the federal government should pay all of the costs of both the benefit amount increase and any emergency extension of UI benefits.\n",
      "Loosen UI eligibility requirements and remove obstacles to take-up. States with very low UI recipiency rates are not providing a UI benefit that adequately protects workers or serves as sufficient fiscal stimulus. An economic slowdown will raise recipiency rates naturally, as it has in past recessions, but states must also remove unnecessary roadblocks to participation and loosen eligibility requirements.\n",
      "Relax job search requirements for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. The usual concerns about UI moral hazard are much less relevant during a crisis like the one we face today. Our focus now should be on replacing the lost income of laid-off workers rather than maximizing recipients’ incentive to find new work. Once the crisis in the United States ends, the UI system can return to its typical balancing of concerns about moral hazard and its core insurance objective.\n",
      "Discourage layoffs with a temporarily enhanced federal experience-rated UI tax for large employers. Employers are already subject to “experience-rated” taxes that in effect penalize them for conducting layoffs, requiring them to help support the UI system that their former employees rely on. These taxes have been shown to discourage job destruction. In the current crisis, policymakers should temporarily enhance—until the public health crisis ends—the federal experience-rated tax for large firms to discourage them from shedding workers. So that employers are not unduly burdened, this should be paired with a large subsidy to employers—conducted through the same UI tax system, in proportion to payroll—so that they come out ahead from this policy if they do not implement large-scale layoffs. This would function in some ways as an employee retention credit, aiding employers that resist the temptation to conduct layoffs.\n",
      "The advantage of this policy is that the crisis may be hoped to end relatively quickly, after which employers may find that they do not, in fact, wish to cut their payroll dramatically. A temporary boost (until the public health crisis ends) to experience-rated taxes, coupled with transfers to employers, can let the UI system fight recessions even before workers receive benefits.\n",
      "These are not the first policies that must be enacted to address the effects of COVID-19—this is first and foremost a public health crisis. But policymakers should be looking for every opportunity to strengthen our safety net and automatic stabilizers. These ambitious reforms to UI would accomplish both objectives. Americans are already experiencing tremendous anxiety about the very real public health dangers we all face—immiseration after job loss should not be added to the list of worries.\n",

      "As part of this effort, if it is not already in the works, the President should require manufacturers of such equipment – especially ventilators – to license at low or no royalties any and all intellectual property rights required for such production to as many other manufacturers that are willing and capable of making this equipment as rapidly as possible, 24/7. The President should further direct FDA to surge its inspector force to ensure that the processes and output of these other manufacturers are in compliance with applicable FDA requirements. The same IP licensing requirement should extend to manufacturers of any other medical supplies expected to be in short supply.\n",

      "Second, to solve the bed shortage problem, some states (such New York) are already investigating the use of existing facilities – schools, university dorms, hotel rooms, and the like. This idea should be mandated immediately, as part of the emergency declaration, nationwide. The President has ordered a Navy hospital ship to help out with extra beds in New York, which is a good idea that should be extended to other coastal cities where this possible. But he should also order the military, as needed, to assist with the conversion efforts of land-based facilities – which require infection-free environments, special filtration systems and the like – where private contractors are not available.\n",
      "The costs for all this should be borne by the federal government, using the Disaster Relief Fund, authorized by the Stafford Act. As of year-end FY 2019, the balance in this fund was approximately $30 billion. It is not clear what the balance is expected to be after the outlays that have recently been ordered by the President, as relief for states and localities. If the DRF needs topping up, this should be urgently provided by the Congress, ideally as part of the third round of fiscal stimulus being considered this week.\n",

      "The COVID-19 public health crisis is an extreme test of the necessity of many parts of our basic daily routine: commuting to the office, face-to-face meetings, and what it means to be a worker in the modern economy. With “social distancing” now an imperative in many places, employers’ transition to telework is poised to remake all of those assumptions, both for the current crisis and beyond.\n",
      "The nation’s largest employer, the federal government, has issued new guidance on liberalizing telework, and this weekend the White House’s Office of Management and Budget urged agencies to “maximize telework flexibilities” for workers in the Washington, D.C. region. And earlier in the month, the nation’s second-largest private employer, Amazon (headquartered in the outbreak locus point of Washington state), asked its Seattle- and Bellevue-based employees to work from home for the remainder of March.\n",
      "This surge in teleworking raises questions about whether the technologies that enable telework—video conferencing, remote desktops, etc.—can scale to handle coronavirus-related traffic, and what we can do to ensure all workers are able to take advantage of it. At the same time, the crisis also forces us to reconsider if there’s a loss of value at all when we don’t work face-to-face.\n",
      "How common is telework already?\n",
      "In 2018, nearly a quarter of the U.S. workforce (23.7%) worked some hours from home on an average day. And according to the Eno Center for Transportation, as of 2017 more Americans work from home than commute via mass transit.\n",
      "Though the numbers are highest for those with advanced degrees, employees across the education spectrum also put in some hours from home. Further, telework isn’t limited to a specific geography—some of the densest metro areas boast high rates of telecommuting, while in rural areas, telework has slowed the “brain drain” some regions experience.\n",

      "In 1964, science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke predicted that doctors on one continent would one day operate on a patient on another continent, but missed the mark a little when he concluded “the city is abolished.” While U.S. telework has grown rapidly, so too has the draw of place, especially for the knowledge economy. Information-sector jobs are clustering more densely in urban areas than ever. These jobs rely heavily on tacit knowledge and intense levels of cooperation between lots of people, which means employers value locations that foster communication, collaboration, interpersonal relationships, and trust. Given this, in recent years some employers have rejected telework. However, as the spread of coronavirus causes some of these employers to temporarily reverse course, we can begin to better understand the real potential of telework in the economy of the future.\n",
      "The prominence of telework in the response to the coronavirus threat is a reminder that the technology can help employers manage other risks as well. For example, telework can enable firms to reduce the risk of losing productivity to regular or catastrophic traffic disruption. Offering telework as a benefit can help employers afford the cost of hiring high-skill labor, and keep these workers connected to the office and each other no matter where they’re based. Teleworking’s reach allows employers access to a larger group of potential workers and, in turn, allows workers access to more job options.\n",
      "The prominence of telework in the response to the coronavirus threat is a reminder that the technology can help employers manage other risks as well.\n",
      "Some have criticized telework as a marginal solution that benefits only white-collar workers. But even a simple, small solution can have a meaningful impact on multiple systemic problems. For example, even modest reductions in peak travel (i.e., commuting) can dramatically decrease traffic congestion, which benefits everyone. Furthermore, locating in an in-demand, high-cost urban area is more affordable for an employer when telework allows them to consume fewer square feet per worker, reducing land and energy consumption. Finally, the economies and societies of places enjoy increased stimulus from workers telecommuting from “third places” such as coffee shops and coworking spaces.\n",
      "All people and places need access to telework\n",
      "As more workers transition to remote work both in response to coronavirus and beyond it, there are structural changes that must be addressed to make it more accessible for everyone. Nearly 10% of working-age adults do not have a home broadband connection, according to American Community Survey data. Nearly a quarter of these broadband nonadopters say that services aren’t available or are too slow where they live. Broadband has long been considered a luxury good, but the transition to mandatory telework due to coronavirus makes it clear that an in-home connection is vital to the functioning of the 21st century economy.\n",
      "The transition to mandatory telework due to coronavirus makes it clear that an in-home connection is vital to the functioning of the 21st century economy.\n",
      "Recognizing the importance of broadband to social and economic functions, the Federal Communications Commission released the Keep Americans Connected Pledge to keep households connected through the fallout of the coronavirus. The pledge asks companies to open up public Wi-Fi networks, waive late fees, and not disconnect consumers over the next two months. A range of internet service providers joined the charge, offering free services to low-income customers or waiving overage fees. But this begs the question: Was internet connectivity not just as essential before? When the coronavirus passes, the FCC needs to take a serious look at what the pandemic has revealed about the importance of both telework and universal broadband access.\n",
      "Telework does not eliminate the benefits of face-to-face work and social interaction, just as online shopping isn’t the end of brick-and-mortar retail. But at a time that requires social distancing, the same technologies that enable remote workers to stay productive can be leveraged to maintain social ties and connections. The coronavirus disruption is demonstrating that digital connectivity, including telework, is a valuable tool that makes places stronger and more resilient.\n",

      "At first blush, it seems like the coronavirus pandemic is shutting down the economy everywhere, equally, with frightening force and totality. In many respects, that’s true: Across the country, consumer spending—which supports 70% of the economy—is crashing in community after community, as people avoid stores, restaurants, movie theaters, offices, and other public places. Already, the layoffs have begun, with reports coming in from both big cities including Seattle and Atlanta as well as small heartland towns.\n",
      "》Download the appendix table\n",
      "But as recession forecasts proliferate, it’s not necessarily true that all areas will be hit equally hard. In a huge nation made up of diverse places and varied local economies, a look at the geography of highly exposed industries makes clear that the economic toll of any coming recession will hit different regions in disparate, uneven ways.\n",
      "To illustrate this, we mapped the employment geography of an array of industries vulnerable to disruption by virus-related demand declines, shutdowns, and layoffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "To do this, we used an identification of the “most at risk” industry groups included in the recent (and quite dire) research note from Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s. Zandi composed a list of five especially vulnerable sectors: mining/oil and gas, transportation, employment services, travel arrangements, and leisure and hospitality. With this list in hand, we mapped those industries’ presence as a share of the economy within the nation’s various metropolitan areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Add the numbers up and the gargantuan scale of the current problem emerges. More than 24.2 million Americans work in the five high-risk sectors facing a sharp slowdown. This will likely prompt significant work disruptions, furloughs, and other uncertainties in the coming months.\n",
      "But what do we find on a metro-area level? The most affected places are a who’s who of energy towns and major resort, leisure, and amusement destinations across the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most exposed metro area nationwide is the oil-and-gas town of Midland, Texas, with 42% of its workforce in high-risk industries. Other major energy producers such as Odessa and Laredo, Texas as well as Houma-Thibodaux, La. also land in the top 10 most affected.\n",
      "The numbers also underscore the massive size of the nation’s reeling leisure and hospitality sector. Kahului, Hawaii, Atlantic City, N.J., and Las Vegas all fall into the top five most recession-vulnerable metro areas, each with more than a third of their workforce in industries threatened by coronavirus-related uncertainties. Other noteworthy affected tourist destinations across the U.S. include Ocean City, N.J., Myrtle Beach, S.C., Flagstaff, Ariz., and the Gulf Coast of Mississippi and Alabama.\n",
      "The same pattern holds across larger cities. Among the nation’s 100 largest metro areas, Las Vegas is most exposed, followed by Orlando, Fla., the theme park capital of the country. Rounding out the top five in this group are New Orleans, which has ties to both the energy and tourism/hospitality sectors, Honolulu, and Oklahoma City.\n",
      "On the other end of the spectrum, the metro areas positioned to be least directly affected by COVID-19 are a diverse group consisting of older, manufacturing-heavy industrial cities, agricultural towns, and some already-distressed places. Agriculture communities Madera, Calif. and Yakima, Wash. are the two least exposed metro areas nationwide, with less than 10% of their workforce in affected industries. Elkhart-Goshen, Ind., the RV capital of the world, rounds out the top three, however its numbers may belie potential manufacturing sector exposure from increased automation, which tends to concentrate in economic downturns.\n",
      "Among the 100 largest metro areas, the economically safest are mostly tech-oriented university towns. Provo, Utah is the least exposed, followed by Durham-Chapel Hill, N.C., Hartford, Conn., Albany, N.Y., and San Jose, Calif.\n",
      "From these lists, we can see that the places most vulnerable to immediate, short-term economic shocks from COVID-19 are geographically varied, but with common industry themes. But because the variations are driven by the nation’s enormous leisure sector in particular, our map provides only an initial glance at which places are going to be affected. In the event that the pandemic tips the economy into a significant nationwide recession, very few places or industries will emerge unscathed. And if that happens, other large sectors—including construction, manufacturing, retail, education, and even the motion picture industry—will be affected regardless of geography.\n",
      "This suggests an important takeaway for policymakers: While essentially all of America will likely be affected by COVID-19’s economic effects, those effects will be distinct and varied from place-to-place. Given that, we must not only act quickly, but also attend to the unique regional and local impacts within this national crisis.\n",

      "DOLLAR: Hi, I’m David Dollar, host of the Brookings trade podcast “Dollar & Sense.” Today my guest is Dexter Roberts, the former Bloomberg Businessweek China bureau chief and the author of the new book, “The Myth of Chinese Capitalism.” We’re going to talk about how the Chinese economy is bouncing back from the coronavirus, but we’re also going to talk about more general features of the Chinese economy. So welcome to the show, Dexter.\n",
      "ROBERTS: Thank you.\n",
      "DOLLAR: So let’s start. Migrant workers play a big role in your book, they’ve played a big role in the Chinese economy, and I think they’ve played a role in the spread of the coronavirus. So let’s start with a general question. Can you explain to the listeners about the special role of migrant workers in the Chinese economy?\n",
      "ROBERTS: Well, I would say that the migrant workers have been a critical element of the Chinese economic model for the last few decades. And what model am I talking about here? I’m talking about the factory to the world export-led model, which was based on largely producing free exports, and it was very much reliant on low-cost wages. And that model really only thrives when China had those low-cost wages, and very low – particularly in the manufacturing sector – very affordable wages competitive to other countries.\n",
      "So that’s been their role for so many years now. As you know, that’s been changing. China’s wages have been going up. I believe average manufacturing wages in China are higher than in Mexico or Malaysia now. So as we’ve seen in recent years, there’s been a big push to diversify the supply chain by many multinationals out of China. And at the same time, the future role of these migrants has become a little bit in question. Now, I do think that we still have a good idea of what role they can play in the future of the Chinese economy, or at least what role officials in the leadership hope that they play. The next step for China really is to move from this factory of the world to a much more consumption-driven economy, a much more service economy. They still want manufacturing, but many of the factories are automating and they want to automate more. And as China makes this transition, I think the next real role for them, and it’s not going to be easy, is to convert them into the middle class and make them become part of this future domestic consumption driver.\n",
      "DOLLAR: Right. It seems possible that the response to the coronavirus could help with that. Why don’t we start with the development of the coronavirus? I mean, we were learning about it right as the main Chinese holiday season was coming on and the response of the Chinese authorities initially was to bury the information, to continue on. My understanding is most of the migrant workers who were working in Hubei, in Wuhan’s province, they went ahead and went home even though the virus was emerging. Is that right?\n",
      "ROBERTS: I think that’s correct. And actually, I think many of them went home before they were even aware of the virus because, as you say, in the early days the leadership was not being open about the severity of the brewing crisis. So a lot of them did go home. This was sort of an unusual situation in that this epidemic really spread and it became public knowledge in China when many of these migrants already were back in their villages. This is typically, as you know, sort of a once-a-year thing. Lunar New Year is often their one opportunity to go back and to their villages, see their relatives, even see their children who often don’t accompany them to their jobs in the cities.\n",
      "DOLLAR: Right. So when they lock down Hubei Province, for example, a lot of the migrants were back at their villages, right? And often in other provinces around China?\n",
      "ROBERTS: That’s correct. Yeah. So they were already back there. They were planning to have a have a holiday from work. But what happened was that holiday from work became forced absence with huge implications for their wages, the money they were earning. In many cases, they were simply unable to return to the cities or very, very commonly, they knew that their factories or the construction sites or the service industries that they were working in had not restarted. So many of them spent a far longer time in their villages. The reality is there’s still many migrants that have not returned as of today.\n",
      "DOLLAR: Do you think the majority of migrants have returned at this point? I should add that, you know, China posted some breathtakingly negative economic numbers for February. So clearly this has had a devastating effect on their economy in February. Their retail sales were down something like 24 percent. Industrial value added was down. But I think it’s hard to get a sense of what’s actually happening on the ground. Do you think a majority of migrants are back now, even if not all of them?\n",
      "ROBERTS: I actually don’t think it’s a majority. And I’ve been talking to some friends, including migrant friends, throughout this crisis. The government, of course, has released figures, not on how many migrants are back, but what proportion of businesses are back in operation. So they told us, I think last Friday, that 90 percent of large-scale or large-sized enterprises were in operation. I believe with SMEs, or small- and medium-enterprises, many of which would be the employers of the migrants, they said that 60 percent were back in operation. That’s somewhat encouraging, but what they did not tell us – I mean, that’s only part of the picture – what they did not tell us was at what level of operation are they at. So we don’t know whether, for example, a factory is back in operation but it’s only got maybe several of its of it of its production lines operating but most of them still are idle. It’s the same thing with service companies as well. “Back in operation” could be defined in many different ways. My understanding is many of them are running way below capacity. For service industries, they may be doing reduced hours and they’re operating with far fewer staff than usual.\n",
      "So I think the reality is many of the migrants have not come back. Obviously, a large number have, but I would wager that it’s actually under half now.\n",
      "DOLLAR: Right. China’s exports were also down very sharply in February, which is not surprising. I think they were down 17 percent. China is starting to get back to work as you just described, but now the rest of the world is really having an escalating crisis: Europe, the United States. So a question for China: even if it can start to recover, is there going to be an external market for all those Chinese exports? Are we actually going to get the demand to get those factories restarted?\n",
      "ROBERTS: Yeah. I think that’s a huge issue. And as we well know, this epidemic is hitting both demand and supply. And so I think the reality is as China starts to get back to work – and particularly in the cities we’re seeing something akin to normalcy again; not fully back, but things are becoming a little more regularized –but the rest of the world, as we know, is in the midst of shutting down its economies. And the idea that there’s going to be demand like we saw before for Chinese products later this year is extremely suspect. It’s just not going to happen. So I think China’s in for a real challenge, sort of a next-wave challenge, as demand globally dries up for its product.\n",
      "DOLLAR: If we could just step away from the coronavirus for a moment and come back to your book –  what do you recommend for Chinese policy in terms of integrating migrants and things China needs to do to create a more equitable, sustainable economic growth path?\n",
      "ROBERTS: Well, obviously, as you well know, they make huge progress in basically spending money and financing improvements in rural education, in rural health care. And that’s very admirable. They’re moving close to eliminating absolute poverty, which again, is quite an amazing feat. But I think, and I argue in my book, what they haven’t done, which very plausibly is a far more significant move, is start to actually liberalize some of these legacy policies that are holding back migrants. And the two policies that I see as the most critical: number one, of course, is the household registration or the hukou policy, which makes it very difficult for these people to actually fully integrate themselves into cities, as you well know. And so they go to the cities, they do their work, but they always are looking back to their village. Their children are usually there. Their elderly parents are there. In most cases there, they’re not able to move them to the cities. So this is this is a very, very key reform. It also, potentially, could start to solve some of the great variances in education if you actually had cities trying to integrate the children of migrants into their schools as well.\n",
      "The other big, big one is the dual land system. So what is a dual land system? It’s this legacy policy that continues to designate land in the countryside as officially owned by the collective. What does that in practice mean? It means that it’s very, very difficult for migrants who typically do have plots of land back in the countryside tying them back to their villages. And farmers find it extremely difficult to actually profit in a serious way from the land that they hold, either by renting or by selling it. And, of course, this stands in marked contrast to what’s happened in the cities where we’ve seen an explosion of wealth based on mainly the sale of apartments. So here we have the dual land system which is tying these migrants like the hukou policy to their villages, but also making it very difficult for them to make a go of it back there. Those two policies are crucial – reform of those two policies.\n",
      "DOLLAR: That all seems very well-analyzed. The way I think about this is when China was having a big export push, there was a certain economic advantage in having the migrants come to the cities in the cities in the way that they do without their families. They were a very low-cost source of labor. You can raise ethical issues about it, but it had a certain economic efficiency. But now that China is the largest exporting nation, you’re not going to see it increasing its share of the world market very much in general. And then you add the coronavirus, the effects could linger on easily for a year or more. So now they really need those people to be urban citizens demanding services and providing consumption demand.\n",
      "So the issues you raised, bringing your family to the city, selling your land in the countryside – the Chinese have this phrase that selling the land could be the first pot of gold that the migrant brings to the city to give them some capital so they can start a business. So all of that really seems like the next generation of economic reform for China. So, I guess, the question I would then ask: is it likely the authorities will use this crisis to accelerate that? They’re going to need stimulus to the economy. They could do their old trick of investing in infrastructure – which, they frankly have built up a lot of infrastructure – or they could put a lot of money into social services so that migrants can bring their families. More housing, different levels of housing for the city so migrants can potentially buy an apartment. Then they’d have to change that land policy. So do you think this crisis might stimulate more of that reform?\n",
      "ROBERTS: Well I certainly hope that it does. And as you pointed out earlier, it’s not just an economic imperative, it’s a real human rights question as well for China. So I really do hope that that’s the case.\n",
      "The early signs haven’t been promising at all. The response by urban residents towards the migrants, certainly in the first month or two of this virus, has been to try to force them from returning to the cities. And there’s many anecdotes of some extreme measures taken, in some cases actually buildings shutting down the heat, the electricity, the water of migrants in their apartments to prevent them from moving back in. And I think a big part of this is fear about the migrants somehow bringing the disease back. As you know, I think almost every housing compound in China now has a guard at the gate and it’s become much more difficult to go in and out of apartment blocks. Which is a good thing in terms of controlling the disease’s spread.\n",
      "My fear is that these sort of almost nativist attitudes towards the outsiders, which is how migrants have long been viewed, is only going to become stronger. Certainly the Chinese government also has an added interest in not seeing what they would characterize as an uncontrolled flow of migrants around the country. Or it’s been called the “blind flow” back in Chinese history. When there were famines and migrants were traveling around to try to basically find food and coming into the cities they referred to it as this “blind flow” that needed to be stopped. So I’m concerned that they actually could move in the other direction.\n",
      "There’s the issue, of course, that was already there which is, whether or not it’s true, this perception that it’s going to cost an enormous amount of money to better integrate the migrants into the cities. As you know, I mean, there’s a counterargument where some officials in China believe it could actually be a real economic plus with hardworking migrants moving in and eventually paying taxes, and that it doesn’t necessarily have to be a burden. But the early signs are not encouraging to me. And, you know, frankly, we’ve been hearing since the 2013 Third Plenum, the important party meeting, that the leadership knows exactly where they need to go on the land system, on hukou and on household registration, and the direction they need to go is rapid reform. And we’ve seen very, very little progress in the intervening years. So I very much hope that they see this reality and they see the benefit of moving towards a real liberalization of these policies going forward, but I can’t say I’m very hopeful right now.\n",
      "DOLLAR: I like your point that potentially this is a very good investment. In this kind of crisis situation, the Chinese government is definitely going to spend more money to stimulate the economy, and they’re going to borrow to finance a lot of that. And they’ve got some debt issues to worry about, but in this emergency situation, it makes sense to borrow and spend. But then there’s the crucial question of what you spend on. And I think their traditional instinct is to build more infrastructure, but if they don’t really need that it’s not going to generate future growth and they’re going to have debt problems. And I hear what you’re saying is actually a big push in health and education in general, but particularly reaching the migrants in the rural services but also making urban services available to migrant families, that’s potentially a very good economic investment for China in the future because they need that labor. They’re going to increasingly need that labor in a more modern economy. If they don’t have it, it’s actually going to slow them down. So that’s a good argument.\n",
      "ROBERTS: Yeah, I think so. And I certainly hope that more and more officials in China recognize that fact and move in that direction. That would be the right way to go – both from an ethical perspective and sort of redressing the way they have treated migrants over the years – and also a key move to bolster the economy going forward.\n",
      "DOLLAR: Yeah, I mean, the U.S. is going to face analogous problems in a totally different situation. We’re going to end up spending a lot of money to try to stimulate the economy. That’s good Keynesian economics. The question is, do you spend it on things that are also addressing other issues in society – inequality or infrastructure – or are you just wasting the money?\n",
      "ROBERTS: Absolutely. As you know, there’s been a tendency for localities to sort of raise their hand and put forward all their pet projects. Too often those are more infrastructure or more development, and there’s a lot of reasons for that, but one big one is that it’s easier for local governments to more quickly see returns on something like that as opposed to spending on education for migrant kids. Another big issue on spending on the local level on education for migrants has been this perception and actual reality that these people are likely to migrate. To do what they do and leave the city. So this idea that you spend all this money to give them a good education and then they go spend their lives traveling in other parts of China and using their skills there, I guess some localities say “what’s the return for us?” If they’re coming back there’s obviously a real return – if they’re coming back to the villages, coming back to the interior.\n",
      "DOLLAR: Yeah. When I worked for the World Bank in China, we had a lot of rural development projects and we would run into that issue all the time, that local government would like to do big infrastructure projects. And our experts would often say, well, there’s not really going to be any return to this. You know, industry is not going to come to your remote rural area. Why don’t you put money in health and education? And the response is exactly what you were just saying. If you provide…basically build up the human capital of people, a lot of them are going to then migrate away and that local government is not going to get the benefit. So, yeah, I think that was a big obstacle.\n",
      "I want to shift gears while we still have time and talk a little bit about the U.S.-China trade deal. We look back now, about two months ago Vice Premier Liu He and President Trump signed this so-called phase one deal. From my own point of view, I think I just learned about the coronavirus in the next few days after that deal. So I wonder what the virus crisis on both sides of the Pacific means for this trade deal and for U.S.-China relations?\n",
      "ROBERTS: The thing about the phase one trade deal is, as you know, it was largely a series of purchase agreements. So the tough stuff – the coercive tech transfer, the intellectual property rights problems, the subsidies hidden and overt – all those things have been saved for an eventual phase two deal, which, of course, we have no idea when that’s going to happen now. But the phase one deal was mainly about China committing to make purchases, for example, agricultural purchases. And from my conversations with people that know agriculture far better than me, from the very beginning the size of those purchases and the ability of China to actually fulfill them was suspect. What China committed to was a substantial hike in what they had been doing in previous years in terms of buying agricultural goods from the United States. And so agricultural trade analysts I was speaking to were saying, “I don’t know how they’re going to do this.” This was before the coronavirus. I think now with the coronavirus it’s quite clear, and we’ve heard this as well the recognition of this fact from some U.S. officials, there’s no way that they’re going to get remotely close to meeting these purchase promises that were made in the phase one deal. So even as the Chinese economy starts to recover they’re just not going to get there. And of course, they just lost a quarter. I think Goldman is saying now they expect negative 9 percent growth in the first quarter of the year for China.\n",
      "So I think that’s phase one. All along we heard from the Trump administration that phase two would follow and they would deal with the harder parts then – [the parts] that I mentioned earlier. And I don’t see that likely to happen either when we’re dealing with the pandemic. I think people are distracted, obviously, by the crisis that’s in their faces right now. Longer term, I’ve actually been skeptical that we can expect a real enforceable phase two deal anytime soon at all. And there’s a lot of reasons for that, but one key one is, I believe that a lot of those policies – tech transfer policies and the subsidy system in the Chinese economy – are actually a really integral part of China’s goals of becoming a globally competitive country with globally competitive companies.\n",
      "So these policies that we object to, which are seen as unfair trading practices and investment practices, they were there when I arrived in the mid-90s in China. The first thing I was writing about was China’s use of forced technology transfer, bad IPR, and subsidies. And, you know, fast forward more than two decades and those exact same things are what we’re arguing with the Chinese about. And there’s a reason for it. I think that those policies ultimately are very important for China. In the path that it’s chosen to pursue, its technological upgrading, I think those policies are important.\n",
      "DOLLAR: Last question, Dexter. The virus obviously hit China first — both the health issue and the economic downturn. Now they seem to be starting to recover, but the crisis is hitting the U.S. So are there lessons, either negative or positive, the U.S. could draw from China’s response to the coronavirus?\n",
      "ROBERTS: I see the response as a two-part one. In the first part, of course, was this cover-up and this downplaying of the growing crisis, which, frankly, caused many people to get sick and people to die as well. There’s research that has come out that suggests that if China had had recognized the severity of the crisis three weeks earlier and been open about it, they could have stemmed ninety five percent of the infections. One week earlier would have reduced it by 60 percent. So this is the first stage and the tremendous blundering that characterized the Chinese response is now one that the world, frankly, is dealing with. So that’s a very negative example, of course. The second part is something very, very different. The latest numbers coming out of China, they’re almost hard to believe. Zero new infections. Maybe it isn’t zero new infections, but it does seem clear that they have made tremendous progress in controlling this disease and bringing it down. The trend lines seem very, very obvious. They seem to be bringing it under control.\n",
      "So I think in that second phase there are things we should learn from. The most obvious one, and the one we’ve done so badly at so far in the U.S., is widescale testing of people, which we’re finally starting to do but we’re way behind the rest of the world and we’re way behind China. I think the dramatic moves to quarantine, to shut down the economy, to halt transportation, I think those are all things that would be a value for us to do more quickly here in the United States.\n",
      "I guess I’d just say one more thing. So that’s the things that China did that we should learn from. I’d just note as well that it’s interesting to look at some of the other countries and regions in Asia and look at the example of Taiwan. They, as you know, did very, very well themselves, but with a little bit less of an authoritarian hand to it. They dusted off their emergency response that they had in place from dealing with SARS in 2003. They coordinated data they were getting from immigration and health. They used monitoring of the population through the mobile phone system. And they basically held the virus at bay. So that’s another positive example for us here in the United States, along with this second phase in China.\n",
      "DOLLAR:  I’m David Dollar, and I’ve been talking to Dexter Roberts, the author of “The Myth of Chinese Capitalism,” a book that will give you a lot of insight into features of the Chinese system and help us also understand how the virus has spread and what the economic impact is.

      "COVID-19 may become not only a huge health crisis, but also a crisis of globalization and global governance. Most obviously, it raises the question of how the world should organize itself against the threat of pandemics. But it also has implications for how globalization is perceived and what that perception means for the future of international cooperation.\n",
      "Five decades of increasing interconnectedness have opened up the world to massive cross-border flows of goods, services, money, ideas, data, and people. While globalization itself is not new, the sheer scale and scope of the current version has made the world unprecedentedly interdependent—and thus fragile.\n",
      "Today’s global socioeconomic infrastructure looks and works like a hub-and-spoke network in which all nodes are separated by very short distances and essential functions are centralized in large hubs. Financial activity is concentrated in the United States, for example, while China is the world’s manufacturing center. This structure is geared toward maximizing efficiency by capturing the benefits of economies of scale and specialization. Indeed, it has helped to lift millions of people out of poverty (although it also has led to greater income inequality and related social malaise in many countries).\n",
      "However, connectivity also creates an enormous—but often hidden—risk of catastrophe. This is because connectivity increases what statisticians call “fat-tailedness,” or the likelihood of inherently unquantifiable extreme events, such as financial crises, a nuclear holocaust, hostile artificial intelligence, global warming, destructive biotechnology, and pandemics.\n",

      "Because critical functional roles are hyperconcentrated and the entire network is so tightly linked, shocks to a central hub such as the U.S. or China can very quickly become systemic and paralyzing. The very reliance on central hubs generates systemic risk, because hubs constitute single points of failure, and the tight interconnectedness between and among hubs and nodes amplifies the potential for cascading failures. That is why the 2008 financial meltdown that originated in the U.S. was so destructive, and why the COVID-19 outbreak that began in China quickly became a global health and economic crisis.\n",
      "Two different political trends are likely to emerge from this unfolding disaster.\n",
      "First, the crisis may prompt moves to reduce global connectedness, including in terms of travel, trade, and financial, digital, and data flows. People may instinctively demand more isolation in many domains. Seeking protection through blanket isolationism would be misguided and counterproductive. But in this case, communities can indeed help to contain the COVID-19 threat by adaptively reducing their connectivity through mitigation measures that increase social distance such as school and business closures, bans on public gatherings, and limitations on public transport while the crisis lasts.\n",
      "Such draconian steps will have high short-term economic and social costs, and they entail undeniable practical and ethical challenges. In hindsight, they may turn out to be unnecessary. But it’s precisely because we can’t predict the spread of COVID-19 that the crisis demands aggressive action early on. As mathematician and risk expert Nassim Nicholas Taleb points out, because exponential growth initially looks deceptively linear, overreaction on the part of policymakers is not only warranted, but required.\n",
      "This is a tactical consideration, not a strategic one: The goal is not to promote deglobalization, but rather to build greater robustness. When risks are potentially ruinous, systemic survival must supersede efficiency considerations. That is why, for example, macroprudential buffers like higher capital requirements in the financial sector are desirable.\n",
      "A clear parallel between the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change is becoming apparent. Both feature emergence, path dependence, feedback loops, tipping points, and nonlinearity. Both entail catastrophic fat-tailed risks ruled by radical uncertainty and call for eschewing traditional cost-benefit analysis—which relies on known probability distributions—in favor of drastic mitigation to reduce exposure. And, importantly, both highlight the need for much closer, forward-looking international cooperation to manage global threats.\n",
      "Indeed, a demand for greater global cooperation is the second and more significant political trend that could emerge from the current crisis. While this might at first sound inconsistent with heightened suspicion of globalization, the necessary reforms can in fact synthesize both trends. Pandemic prevention and containment is a global public good, and providing it requires increased global coordination as well as adaptive, temporary, and coordinated decoupling.\n",
      "For starters, there is both a need for and an opportunity to introduce global “circuit breakers” that can isolate systemic risks early on and prevent them from spreading. These mechanisms will be most effective if they are clear, transparent, designed in advance, and embedded in a global governance system that legitimizes and continuously updates them. For example, governments could craft and adopt common protocols for temporary travel and trade restrictions in the event of a potential pandemic, supported by globally agreed-upon early-warning systems and thresholds for action.\n",
      "In addition, the international community may wish to build functional redundancy into complex systems—including finance, value chains, food supply, and public health—in order to prevent central hubs from becoming choke points and to ensure that single failures do not cascade into systemic collapse. Although this would entail some reshoring and deconcentration at the expense of efficiency, economies of scale, and comparative advantage, the goal is not autarky but rather risk reduction through diversification.\n",
      "Humanity must organize itself to mitigate the tail risks associated with climate change, pandemics, bioterror, and unmanaged artificial intelligence. Although this will require a historic leap, major crises often open the political space for radical reforms. Precisely at a time when rules-based multilateralism is in retreat, perhaps the fear and losses arising from COVID-19 will encourage efforts to bring about a better model of globalization.\n",

      "Japan is a frontline state in the ongoing global health crisis brought about by the emergence of a highly infectious viral disease quickly spreading from China to its neighbors and beyond. The coronavirus crisis stands to deal a severe blow to the Japanese economy, has raised significant questions of the government’s ability to deal with a pandemic, and has altered both domestic political dynamics and Japan’s diplomatic calendar in a landmark year. The associated disease, COVID-19, is likely to extend a large shadow on the remainder of the Shinzo Abe era.\t\n",

      "The economy\n",
      "The economic impact of the coronavirus crisis stands to be severe, hitting Japan at a moment of particular vulnerability. Last October, the Abe administration went ahead with a twice-postponed increase of the consumption tax (from 8% to 10%) in order to cover mounting social security expenses due to the rapid graying of the population. Raising taxes is always a politically perilous proposition, but especially so in Japan, where past tax hikes have resulted in sharp economic contraction (both in 1998 and 2014). The Abe government insisted it had learned these lessons and had readied countermeasures to make any economic dip short-lived. And it remained steadfast in insisting that only a Lehman Brothers-type shock (the collapse of the large American financial firm, which marked the onset of the global financial crisis of 2008) would justify yet another postponement. Banking on five years of continued economic expansion in Japan, the government went ahead with the consumption tax increase last fall.\n",
      "A new pathogen triggering a global pandemic is the ultimate black swan. For Japan it has brought back the prospect of a recession, as it negates the possibility of a V-shaped recovery from the severe downturn registered in the last quarter of 2019: an annualized contraction of 7.1% with sharp drops in business investment and private consumption. Moreover, the nature and geography of the COVID-19 outbreak present formidable challenges for the engines of Japanese economic growth. The social distancing measures that are essential to mitigate the spread of a communicable disease will only further dampen consumption and discourage business investment. The tourism boom (with the goal of 40 million visitors in the year of the Olympics) is now irremediably compromised. The near standstill over the past few weeks of the Chinese economy, Japan’s largest trading partner, represents both a demand and supply shock with large Japanese auto firms already cutting production in some factories at home due to disruptions in supply chains.\n",
      "Japan’s ill-starred fate is that the worst economic downturn since the global financial crisis came on the heels of its own domestic contraction. With the new facts on the ground, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has revised downward Japan’s growth rate for 2020 from 0.6% to 0.2%. But the outlook continues to deteriorate with the plunge of the oil market, the pronounced appreciation of the yen, and the fall of the Nikkei stock market below 20,000 points.\n",
      "Government competence\n",
      "The Japanese public, like every other public, is most concerned with the competence (or lack thereof) of the government in dealing with this public health crisis. Confirmed cases of coronavirus in Japan currently surpass 1,000, with most of them (700) originating from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The handling of the quarantine on the ship has been the subject of great scrutiny, with increasing reports of lax protocols undermining the effort to contain the disease aboard and possibly after passengers disembarked.\n",

      "Decisions on travel restrictions have also been controversial. For weeks, the Japanese government only applied curbs on Chinese visitors from the epicenter of the outbreak in Hubei province, and it was not until March 9 that more stringent border controls became operative. Henceforth, visitors from China and South Korea can only land on two designated airports, must self-quarantine for two weeks, and tourist visas are temporarily rescinded — a move that triggered a sharp rebuke from South Korea.\n",
      "As cases of community dissemination continue to grow and testing for COVID-19 moves at a sluggish pace, broader questions have emerged on the government’s ability to act decisively. Without question the Abe team has boosted Japan’s executive decisionmaking capabilities: The prime minister’s office has operated as a “control tower” taming endemic bureaucratic sectionalism, and it instituted a new National Security Council to provide a whole-of-government response to Japan’s national security threats.\n",
      "But COVID-19 bedevils these structures. For one, it requires infection disease experts, not bureaucrats, to be on the lead, and Japan does not have a Centers for Disease Control-like organization. But it also raises thorny questions about how much the government can impinge on personal freedoms for the sake of a national emergency. In fact, the government has found the extant legal framework wanting, pushing instead for a new special emergency law that will only be voted upon this week, further delaying more forceful action.\n",
      "Politics\n",
      "Crises always have consequences, and COVID-19 has already made its weight felt on Japan’s diplomatic calendar and domestic political dynamics. Prime Minister Abe is already the longest-serving prime minister in Japan’s history, but some political observers entertained the possibility of a longer tenure if the party moved to award Abe a fourth term beyond 2021. The American presidential election figured prominently in that scenario as one of Abe’s strong suits is to be a “Trump whisperer” of sorts — shielding Japan from the risks of a president skeptical of alliances and trade. But a more immediate scenario has intruded, one where public disenchantment with the Abe government’s response to the coronavirus (with a drop of 8% in public support in the last few weeks) gives new impetus to Abe’s rivals and would-be successors within the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).\n",
      "2020 was geared to be a major year for Japanese diplomacy, with a number of signal events that would also marshal Prime Minister Abe’s legacy. A state visit by President Xi Jinping to herald the stabilization of Japan-China relations has been postponed. And the fate of the summer Olympics hangs in the balance of a still little-understood new global health risk.\n",

      "The COVID-19 epidemic sweeping the globe has affected millions of students, whose school closures have more often than not caught them, their teachers, and families by surprise. For some, it means missing class altogether, while others are trialing online learning—often facing difficulties with online connections, as well as motivational and psychosocial well-being challenges. These problems point to a critical gap in school-based contingency planning within broader education sector preparedness planning and emergency management.\t\n",

      "Contingency planning is a management tool to analyze the impact of potential crises and ensure appropriate arrangements are made to respond in a timely and effective way. The tool enables individuals, teams, and organizations to establish working relationships that can make a critical difference during a crisis. As such, education sector and school-based contingency planning for COVID-19 are essential to ensure that schools can manage future uncertainty by developing responses based on different outbreak scenarios, including variations in severity of illness, mode of transmission, and rates of infection in the community. The United Nations Inter-Agency Standing Committee has noted that an effective response at the onset of a crisis is heavily influenced by the level of preparedness and contingency planning.\n",
      "Education sector preparedness aims to protect students and educators, plan for continuity of education, and safeguard education sector investments, all of which ultimately contribute to strengthened resilience through education. The CDC and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services preparedness guidance for school-based pandemic flu notes that school-based outbreaks often give rise to community-wide outbreaks; thus, planning and practicing for such epidemics are an act of safeguarding not only the health of students and staff, but also of the wider community (see guidance below).\n",
      "Much of the global guidance for schools relating to the current COVID-19 epidemic focuses on keeping schools safe and students and teachers physically healthy through personal and environmental nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). This includes communication about everyday preventative actions like encouraging students and staff to stay home when they are sick, covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands often, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces and objects. Other schools in communities with isolated cases of the virus are instituting community NPIs, such as increasing space between people at school to at least three feet, making attendance and sick-leave policies more flexible, postponing or canceling large school events, and temporarily dismissing students.\n",
      "The CDC guidance notes that in a severe pandemic, “dismissing schools preemptively before flu becomes widespread in schools and communities can help slow the spread of the disease in the community.” While many schools around the world have some sort of preparedness plan in place to deal with natural disasters, armed violence, flu and other emergencies, the vast majority have not planned for the prospect of monthlong or longer school closures, as is happening in China, Japan, and other countries to prevent COVID-19 from spreading. As a result, many schools, teachers, and families lack guidance about how to prepare for educational continuity and psychosocial support to students during long-term out-of-school closures.\n",
      "Promising actions but critical gaps remain\n",
      "UNICEF and Save the Children, two leaders in the education emergencies field, have health teams working with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners on multirisk preparedness activities across hundreds of country offices to ensure the safety of education programs, children, and affected communities. UNICEF is working with the International Federation of Red Cross and WHO to develop key messages and actions for COVID-19 prevention and control in schools that will serve as the basis for country-level guidance on risk mitigation and safety. This will include specific messages, actions, and checklists for school administrators, teachers, and staff; parents and community members; and students and children. The guidance will also contain a section on engaging students of different ages in health education to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 and other viruses and to develop media literacy and critical thinking skills to combat social stigma and become active citizens. Save the Children is leading READY, a global consortium aimed at strengthening nongovernmental organizations to support affected governments for major disease outbreaks or pandemics, advocating that children’s best interests are at the center of every response. These actions by UNICEF and Save the Children to protect children and schools through preparedness are important, but neither tackle the preparedness aim of providing educational continuity during school closures.\n",
      "This lack of research on and guidance for planning educational continuity is disastrous, as education is itself a form of psychosocial support that promotes holistic well-being during crises.\n",
      "Yet the issue of how to provide quality educational continuity remotely that supports not only learning but also the psychosocial well-being of both students and educators is critical to effective preparedness and response. Countless countries over the past several decades—from Syria and Afghanistan to Somalia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and beyond—have trialed distance and flexible learning approaches to maintain a degree of educational continuity during times of crisis. Unfortunately, the learning from these trials has neither been systematically monitored nor evaluated to measure the impact of these different approaches. Moreover, it is not only the mechanism and approach that is used—from radio, podcast, or television broadcasts to online programs or virtual peer learning circles—but also the quality and methods of teaching that are critical to understand; this opens another set of important, but as of yet, largely unexamined questions about training and support for teachers in already strained educational environments. Until there is evidence on what alternative modes and methods work, and under what circumstances, it will be largely impossible for school districts and individual schools to develop comprehensive strategies needed for education contingency planning.\n",
      "This lack of research on and guidance for planning educational continuity is disastrous, as education is itself a form of psychosocial support that promotes holistic well-being during crises. Intentional investment in education-based psychosocial support and social and emotional learning for children and youth affected by crises can help them learn more readily. Indeed, psychosocial well-being is a significant precursor to learning and has an important bearing on the future prospects of both individuals and societies.\n",
      "This COVID-19 epidemic is surely not the last epidemic that will threaten school continuity, especially given research on how climate change will affect infectious disease occurrence. Schools must immediately update their emergency preparedness plans by developing contingency plans that not only address school-based prevention and safety measures for epidemics, but also identify ways to continue educating and supporting students and teachers if schools are closed. At the same time, the global education community must strengthen monitoring, evaluation, and documentation of alternative modes and methods of distance and flexible education work, including how they support the psychosocial well-being of learners and teachers. Ultimately, the global education community should synthesize existing research about distance and flexible education interventions in crisis contexts that can be contextualized at the school-level, so that the next time an epidemic strikes, schools are better prepared to not only protect students and educators, but to continue quality education.\n",

      "The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the crucial importance of health information technology and data interoperability. The pandemic has shattered our common beliefs about the type and scope of health information exchange. It has shown us that the definition of health data should no longer be limited to medical data of patients and instead should encompass a much wider variety of data types from individuals’ online and offline activity. Moreover, the pandemic has proven that healthcare is not local. In an interconnected world, with more individuals traveling long distances than ever before, it is naïve to look at regions in isolation from each other and try to manage public health independently. To efficiently manage a pandemic like this, the scope of health information exchange efforts should not be limited to small geographical regions and instead should be done at least nationally, if not internationally.\n",
      "Health data should go beyond medical records\n",
      "A wide variety of factors affect one’s overall well-being, a very small fraction of which could be quantified via medical records. We tend to ignore this fact, and try to explain and predict a patient’s condition only based on medical data. Previously, we did not have the technology and knowledge to collect huge amounts of non-medical data and analyze it for healthcare purposes. Now, privacy concerns and outdated regulations have exacerbated the situation and has led to a fragmented data ecosystem. Interoperability, even among healthcare providers, remains a major challenge where exchange and analysis of non-medical data for healthcare purposes almost never happens.\n",
      "The experience of countries that, despite all odds, could successfully contain the coronavirus epidemic highlights the importance of exchanging and analyzing non-medical data for successful population health management. Take Taiwan as an example: the government could merge the travel history of its citizens with their medical data and make that information readily available to health care providers. Such a simple application would allow public health officials to prioritize their containment efforts on those with high risk of being infected.

      "More interestingly, the public health officials in Taiwan used citizens’ mobile phones to monitor those under quarantine. Mobile data could also be easily used to precisely track the locations that patients with positive coronavirus had visited recently. Analysis of such data would provide priceless information for public health officials and helps them to better track potentially infected people.\n",
      "One of the major concerns with epidemics is overburdening the healthcare system. If it goes uncontrolled, many people will need hospitalization at the same time, straining the capacity of hospitals. This problem could be mitigated if telehealth technologies could be widely adopted by patients and providers. These technologies would allow automation of monitoring of indicators such as body temperature or oxygen levels. Coupled with the other types of data such as medical and travel history of patients, they could further prioritize those who need immediate medical care. Moreover, healthcare providers could connect with many more concerned patients through telehealth technologies and alleviate unnecessary trips to emergency rooms. This would significantly reduce redundant traffic at hospitals that  impedes the provision of medical services.\n",
      "Health data should be exchanged nationally\n",
      "Communication and exchange of data between the federal government and the local health authorities is never more important than during epidemics. The success of these efforts hinges on real-time collection and analysis of data as well as instant decisionmaking and communication to states and localities. A nationwide health information exchange could prove to be vital for early identification and even prediction of the centers of the epidemics. Such a system could enable the government to quarantine smaller areas before the virus spreads, or to efficiently allocate rare medical resources such as N-95 masks or test kits to providers in areas that are most likely to be at the center of the epidemic. Despite its benefits, the U.S. is still very far from having such an information network.\n",

      "The national efforts to create a nationwide health information exchange initiated more than a decade ago. The focus of these efforts was to build regional health information exchanges and then connect those together in order to create a nationwide network. Although these efforts have not all been successful, alternative approaches have emerged. Those include interoperability within the networks of large electronic health records providers, patient mediated exchanges, and peer-to-peer direct exchanges. Coincidentally, new rules by both Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services now require providers to adopt application programming interfaces to allow patients easily access their medical data at no cost.  These new rules are huge steps toward creating a nationwide health information exchange network. They attempt to create a data ecosystem that enables more innovation involvement from private market. I believe these rules are huge steps towards a nationwide health information exchange system. Policy makers should in the meantime consider replacing regulations that hinder the exchange of health data outside of the healthcare market with the ones that protect the privacy of patients in a more compatible way with today’s technologies and demands.\n",

      "As the public health crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, the economic consequences are becoming increasingly clear. To halt the spread of this disease, public officials and firms are making policy and business decisions that are rapidly bringing parts of the economy to a necessary standstill. Spending will fall rapidly at many businesses as people practice social distancing; firms are shutting down—hopefully temporarily; and millions of workers are experiencing reduced income (whether through hours reductions, furloughs, or layoffs), which will in turn put further downward pressure on spending. \t\n",

      "The federal policy response thus far has focused on public health. First, Congress authorized $8 billion of funding for the health agencies. Second, the House of Representatives passed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. This legislation will try to directly combat the virus and cushion those affected by: funding testing, creating and funding sick leave for many workers, and providing funds to states via Medicaid funds. The bill also includes more funding for unemployment insurance and unemployment insurance extensions, more funding for emergency SNAP benefits and waivers of SNAP work requirements, and flexibilities and funding to ensure that young and school-age children have access to food during school closures and quarantines. Taken together, these provisions are meant to support broader public health and individual health, but also the economic and food security of American households.\n",
      "But these first two legislative steps will not be sufficient to address the economic fallout that is the necessary result of policies and decisions taken to preserve lives in the short-term.\n",
      "The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates to zero, and while it has other tools to stimulate the economy, a crisis like this requires fiscal as well as monetary responses. The legislation passed thus far has been important, but another round of fiscal policy will be required immediately to fully address this crisis.\n",
      "A robust fiscal response can provide income support to households, ensure broad and continuous access to safety net programs, provide incentives for employers to avoid layoffs, provide loans to small businesses, give liquidity cushions to households and firms, and otherwise stimulate the economy.\n",
      "Specifically:\n",
      "\n",
      "Provide income support to a wider array of households. The Families First Act expands access to paid sick leave and unemployment insurance, but far more people are losing income, tips, commissions, and hours than are helped through this legislation. Too many American households live on the financial edge and will require support whether or not they meet eligibility requirements for safety net programs. Potential options for providing income support to households include:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Providing cash aid to current holders of Electronic Benefits Transfer system (e.g. participants in the SNAP program).\n",
      "Providing a bonus round of the Earned Income Tax Credit (proposed by Representatives Khanna and Ryan);\n",
      "Reducing withholding to boost take home pay (proposed by Claudia Sahm);\n",
      "Sending checks to most (or all) households (proposed by Jason Furman) to ensure they can continue their spending on necessities and then help restart the economy when many constraints are removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "These options have different advantages and drawbacks. Leveraging the EBT system would be fast and well targeted. SNAP recipients may be the most necessary group to reach (they are 36 million of the Americans with the lowest incomes before the crisis), but many households would be left out (especially those without children). Changing tax withholding could also provide income support quickly, but it would only help those with income and will not provide much for the lowest-income individuals. EITC bonus payments or direct checks would both be helpful, but may take longer (a matter of months, not weeks) and may not be the best front-line defense.\n",
      "A combined option: provide cash to all SNAP households by putting $250 per household member on the EBT cards as non-restricted cash (~$10 billion). In addition, send $1000 checks per adult to households (with an income cap that can be applied later as part of 2020 taxes) (~$200 billion) with checks for dependents of $500, which may take longer to mail (~$50 billion) due to the necessity to match dependents to households. Importantly, none of these funds should count against income thresholds for other public support. Congress could also allocate more funds to states via emergency TANF block grants to let states support the most vulnerable in a flexible way (~$10 billion).\n",
      "\n",
      "Give liquidity cushions to households and firms. While the economic consequences of the pandemic are likely to generate a recession, the most acute portion (when much economic activity is paused) could be measured in months not years. Many households and firms could face temporary cash constraints. One option is for the federal government to simply not ask for payments in the short run. For example, all student loan payments (not just interest) could be paused without penalty (or depending on the structure of the loan, the government could make the payment to the vendor and simply add the payment to the end of the loan). All small business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration could be temporarily paid by the government. Tax payment deadlines (for both businesses or individuals who have not filed their 2019 taxes) could be extended 3 months. None of these actions would stop a recession or even cause a recovery after one, but they could generate space for some households and firms during the acute portion of the crisis. Because the government borrows so inexpensively, a brief delay in payments is not expensive to the government.\n",
      "Additional loans for small businesses: The Small Business Administration could make more loan guarantees for firms. This may be a difficult time for many firms to borrow, though, as solvency pressures would make fair underwriting quite challenging for many lenders. Still, it is worth implementing for the firms that are able to qualify for loans.\n",
      "Provide fiscal relief to firms based on maintaining payroll. Many small and mid-size firms could face extreme pressure to cut hours or employment. As some have noted, relief to households is important but would not necessarily help firms because many households will constrain their spending beyond necessities until the public health crisis is over (see Hamilton and Veuger). One way to try to shift their incentives—and provide the financial means to retain payroll—is to grant tax relief to firms based on the number of employees working at least 20 hours per week. One specific option is to allow payroll tax credits for up to 100 employees working at least half time, up to a monthly wage of $4,000. These caps would make sure the government is not sending billions to already profitable large firms or giving large payments per employee to small firms made up of highly paid professionals. The goal would be to provide relief to a small business that is trying to keep workers on the payroll. For example, a firm with 50 employees making $48,000 a year would receive $250 a month per employee. Cutting hours, wages, or employment would reduce the payments. This would cost $50-100 billion over 6 months with the overwhelming bulk going to firms with fewer than 100 employees. One could limit this to firms that maintain a certain percentage of payroll, but that might prevent support to those firms in the most desperate situations.\n",
      "Provide wider stimulus support to the economy based on economic data. As many have noted this economic contraction will require help to households (point 1), but it is impossible to prevent some economic contraction given the social distancing restrictions that are being put in place. Importantly, given the possibility that the current scenario generates a deeper recession, Congress should pass policies with automatic triggers that kick in over time if the economy stays weak, including additional payments to households and states. For example, if the unemployment rate rises and stays elevated, additional payments to households could be made over time. More funds could go to states via FMAP. More funds could go to infrastructure via BUILD. Last June, the Hamilton Project and The Washington Center for Equitable Growth published a book of ideas for automatic stabilizers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, if the unemployment rate rises half a percentage point (or the employment-to-population ratio falls half a percentage point in the next six months or the broader measure of unemployment (U6) rises a percentage point), then more direct household payments could go out to individuals, with another round of payments a year from now if the unemployment rate remains elevated; SNAP maximum benefits could be increased; unemployment insurance payments could be increased; and, unemployment insurance extensions could be automatically passed. These policies would provide ongoing support for the economy in the event of a deeper recession.\n",
      "\n",
      "Congress should continue to fix holes in the safety net and create exceptions for the unique circumstances of the current health crisis. It could waive disability reviews to make sure the disabled are not going into doctors’ offices during a health crisis simply to satisfy a bureaucratic requirement (suggested by Rebecca Vallas). Congress could extend paid sick leave to a wider pool of employees instead of limiting it to mid-sized employers. Congress could continue to create flexibility within unemployment insurance and SNAP programs to make sure they can respond appropriately in this crisis. Congress can support childcare, in particular for health workers or others who must continue to work while schools are closed.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "The actions taken by both Congress and the Federal Reserve have been important. It is increasingly clear, though, that there will be substantial economic fallout. More needs to be done to cushion the incomes of affected workers, support small and mid-size firms, and support the economy more broadly.\n",

      "As we’ve written previously, 53 million people in the U.S.—44% of the country’s workers—earn low wages. Their median hourly earnings are $10.22, and for those who work full time year-round, median annual earnings are about $24,000. These workers already sit in precarious economic circumstances, but as the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps the globe and fears of a recession abound, they’re at greater risk than ever.\n",
      "》Explore the interactive\n",
      "Some of the most common low-wage jobs are inherently interpersonal in nature (think retail and food service) and are thus uniquely vulnerable to the spread of COVID-19, both as a health and economic matter. Many low-wage workers are barely making ends meet—we estimate that about half are either the sole earner in their family or contribute substantially to family budgets. Moreover, they are less likely than higher-earning workers to receive health insurance or paid leave through their employment.\n",
      "Reports of widespread layoffs and furloughs are coming in, concentrated in retail, food service, and accommodations jobs. Our workforce and safety net programs are currently ill-equipped for job losses of this magnitude, and a host of policies are under consideration in response. These include federal efforts to provide limited paid leave to more workers, cash sent directly to workers, and assistance for small businesses.\n",
      "Our data illustrate the sheer number of vulnerable workers who will need such help, and how geographically dispersed they are across the country. This highlights the need for aggressive, creative responses at the federal, state, and local levels.\n",
      "Using our new interactive tool, you can explore the data on low-wage workers across 373 metropolitan areas. Depending on the region, between 30% and 62% of all workers earn low wages, with median hourly wages ranging from $8.40 to $12.65.\n",
      "The largest metro areas have the highest absolute numbers of low-wage workers. For example, there are 2.7 million in the Los Angeles region (53% of the workforce), which includes 500,000 retail workers, cooks, and food servers.\n",
      "Smaller regions may have smaller numbers of low-wage workers, but those numbers are still substantial within the context of the local economy. Among regions with populations between 500,000 and 1 million, for example, low-wage workers make up between 35% and 56% of the total workforce. In Albuquerque, N.M., that translates into 155,000 people, including 13,000 retail workers and 17,000 cooks and food servers. In Akron, Ohio—a region with a more industrial economic base and a whiter, older population—there are 111,000 low-wage workers, including 10,000 in retail and 13,000 cooks and food servers.\n",
      "In midsized metro areas with populations between 250,000 and 500,000, low-wage workers make up 37% to 58% of all workers. In Norwich, Conn., 37% of workers (41,000 total people) earn low hourly wages, and nearly 10,000 of them are in retail or food service jobs. On the other side of the country in Eugene, Ore., there are 67,000 low-wage workers, including 7,000 food service workers and 6,000 retail workers.\n",
      "As policymakers weigh different stimulus measures, they should keep these millions of low-wage workers front and center as a priority. In the short term, immediate cash assistance seems likely, and it’s the right call. But it’s a stopgap measure—many of these workers were barely making ends meet even before COVID-19. Industries such as restaurants, cruise lines, and hotels are seeking massive federal relief. As the government engages in discussions with industry groups, negotiations should include business practices on issues such as worker pay, benefits, and training that can lift workers out of the near-poverty they were already facing.\n",
      "At some point, this crisis will pass. As we move through it, let’s seek to create jobs that can sustain families and communities and promote broad-based economic well-being—not simply return to the status quo.\n",

      "NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several more U.S. governors on Monday joined the procession of states ordering millions of Americans to stay at home to slow the spread of the coronavirus, while President Trump signaled he’s considering a move in the opposite direction. Public health authorities have pushed for the stay-at-home restrictions as essential to curb widespread transmission of a highly contagious respiratory virus that has infected more than 42,000 people in the United States, killing at least 559.  While a wave of statewide social distancing measures expanded, further stifling the U.S. economy amid another day of plunging stock prices and growing fears of a global recession, Trump said, “we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.” “America will again and soon be open for business,” Trump told a White House news conference. “We are not going to let it turn into a long-lasting financial problem.” A $2 trillion economic stimulus bill, however, stalled in the U.S. Senate as Democrats pressed for more money for states and hospitals and restrictions on business bailouts. The president said he would re-evaluate his administration’s position on whether to continue restricting business activity at the end of the month, after the lapse of a 15-day guidance the White House issued on March 15 to limit social interactions and curb unnecessary travel. Trump suggested it was possible to ease up on businesses in states experiencing what he said were relatively low infection rates, like Nebraska, Idaho and Iowa, while continuing to clamp down on hot zones in other states, such as New York. “If it were up to the doctors, they’d say let’s shut down the entire world,” Trump said. MORE STATES IN LOCKDOWN Since last week, governors in at least 18 states accounting for nearly half the U.S. population have issued directives requiring residents to stay mostly indoors, except for necessary trips to grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations and doctors’ offices. “Non-essential” businesses have also been ordered closed. The measures are based on social distancing principles aimed at increasing the amount of space between individuals in order to stem transmission of a potentially lethal illness that threatens to overwhelm the nation’s hospitals. Washington, which accounts for over a quarter of the deaths, became the latest state to issue “stay at home” orders. “This is a human tragedy on a scale we cannot yet project. So it’s time to hunker down to win this fight,” Washington Governor Jay Inslee said.  The USNS Mercy, a Navy hospital ship, departs the Naval Station San Diego and heads to the Port of Los Angeles to aid local medical facilities dealing with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients, in San Diego, California, U.S., March 23, 2020. REUTERS/Mike BlakeEven before statewide restrictions began to go into effect last week, the coronavirus pandemic had virtually paralyzed sectors of the U.S. economy and shattered U.S. lifestyles as school districts and colleges canceled classes, and many companies shuttered workplaces, either voluntarily or under local government orders. While Trump’s latest remarks showed his concern about the economic fallout, state and local officials continued to raise alarms about a healthcare delivery system in danger of collapse. California Governor Gavin Newsom said on Monday his state needs 50,000 additional hospital beds to accommodate a surge in coronavirus patients predicted by computer modeling.      New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio appealed for ventilators, masks and other medical equipment, even asking for help from private citizens.  New York state is now at the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak with 157 deaths, the most of any state.    Karine Raymond, a nurse at Jack D. Weiler Hospital in New York City’s Bronx borough, said most nurses were unable to get specialized N95 masks and even simpler surgical masks were in short supply. Nurses are being told to wear them for as long as possible, she said. “We are the be all and end all and lifeline to these patients, and yet we are being contaminated and cross contaminating,” Raymond said. RESCUES SOUGHT BY FED, CONGRESS  A far-reaching economic stabilization package for the coronavirus crisis failed to advance on Monday in the Senate after Democrats said it contained too little money for hospitals  and not enough restrictions on a fund to help big businesses. Democrats predicted a modified version would win passage soon. Both Democrats and Republicans say they are aware that failure to agree on the bill could have a devastating effect on states, cities and businesses, and trigger further heavy losses in U.S. stock markets. Wall Street’s slide deepened on Monday as an unprecedented moves by the U.S. Federal Reserve to shore up credit across the economy proved insufficient to sooth investors’ fears about the swiftly spreading coronavirus. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 3.04% to end at 18,591.93 points, while the S&P 500, a broader-market index, lost 2.93% to 2,237.4. The S&P 500 is now down about 34% from its February record high, its lowest level since fears of the coronavirus swept across Wall Street.     The steps briefly lifted U.S. stock index futures but share prices quickly dropped back into the red, putting the S&P 500 on pace for its worst month since World War Two.     Slideshow (22 Images)A lack of coordinated federal action was causing chaos for states and municipalities, and even putting them in competition with each other for medical resources, the governors of New York, New Jersey and Illinois said.       The states “are all out looking for the same thing,” New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy told CNN on Monday.

      "(Reuters) - Here’s what you need to know about the coronavirus right now: A worker sprays disinfectant at a mosque, which is closed during the movement control order due to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia March 24, 2020. REUTERS/Lim Huey TengEndless stimulus pitted against economic reality In its latest drastic step, the U.S. Fed offered to buy unlimited amounts of assets to steady financial markets and expanded its mandate to include corporate and municipal bonds. The promise eased some strains in markets in Asia although Wall Street seemed unimpressed. Analysts cautioned it would do little to offset the near-term economic damage done by mass lockdowns and layoffs.    Business surveys scheduled to be issued on Tuesday are expected to demonstrate the devastation on the global economy of the virus. In Japan, the services sector shrank at its fastest pace on record this month, and similarly grim forecasts are expected from the euro zone and the United States later on Tuesday. The spread Confirmed coronavirus cases crossed 377,000 across 194 countries and territories as of 0200 GMT on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally, with over 16,500 deaths linked to the virus. Almost 40,000 cases and over 1,800 deaths were reported in the past day. It took exactly 30 days for the first 40,000 cases to be reported, and then 15 days for the second 40,000. Of the top 10 countries by case numbers, Italy has reported the highest fatality rate, at around 10%, which is reflective of its older population. The fatality rate globally is around 4.3%. While new infections remain low in China, the country has seen a noticeable rebound in cases over the past week, largely from people returning the country. On Tuesday it reported 78 new cases, roughly double the number reported on Monday, as restrictions ease.     Grounded planes look for a parking space  Taxiways, maintenance hangars and even runways at major airports are being transformed into giant parking lots for more than 2,500 airliners, the biggest of which takes up about as much room as an eight-storey building with a footprint 3/4 the size of an American football field. The number of planes in storage has doubled to more than 5,000 since the start of the year, according to Cirium data, with more expected to be parked in the coming weeks as carriers like Australia’s Qantas Airways and Singapore Airlines cut flight schedules. All around the world, leaders urge ‘go home, stay home’ Police in Britain have the power to disperse gatherings, and overseas Britons have been advised to return home immediately. In Canada, officials have said that people ignoring advice to self-isolate could be fined or arrested, and on Tuesday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern appealed to New Zealanders for their help.  “This plan will only work if you help us,” she said in an interview to state broadcaster TVNZ. “You may feel resilient and well, but it’s not just about you.

      "본문 : \n",
      "WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Elite hackers tried to break into the World Health Organization earlier this month, sources told Reuters, part of what a senior agency official said was a more than two-fold increase in cyberattacks. Traffic passes the Regional Office for the Americas of the World Health Organization (WHO) during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Washington, D.C., U.S. March 22, 2020. REUTERS/Raphael SatterWHO Chief Information Security Officer Flavio Aggio said the identity of the hackers was unclear and the effort was unsuccessful. But he warned that hacking attempts against the agency and its partners have soared as they battle to contain the coronavirus, which has killed more than 15,000 worldwide. The attempted break-in at the WHO was first flagged to Reuters by Alexander Urbelis, a cybersecurity expert and attorney with the New York-based Blackstone Law Group, which tracks suspicious internet domain registration activity. Urbelis said he picked up on the activity around March 13, when a group of hackers he’d been following activated a malicious site mimicking the WHO’s internal email system.  “I realized quite quickly that this was a live attack on the World Health Organization in the midst of a pandemic,” he said. Urbelis said he didn’t know who was responsible, but two other sources briefed on the matter said they suspected an advanced group of hackers known as DarkHotel, which has been conducting cyber-espionage operations since at least 2007. Messages sent to email addresses maintained by the hackers went unreturned. When asked by Reuters about the incident, the WHO’s Aggio confirmed that the site spotted by Urbelis had been used in an attempt to steal passwords from multiple agency staffers. “There has been a big increase in targeting of the WHO and other cybersecurity incidents,” Aggio said in a telephone interview. “There are no hard numbers, but such compromise attempts against us and the use of (WHO) impersonations to target others have more than doubled.” The WHO published an alert last month - available here here - warning that hackers are posing as the agency to steal money and sensitive information from the public. And government officials in the United States, Britain and elsewhere have issued cybersecurity warnings about the dangers of a newly remote workforce as people disperse to their homes to work and study because of the coronavirus pandemic. The motives in the case identified by Reuters aren’t clear. United Nations agencies, the WHO among them, are regularly targeted by digital espionage campaigns and Aggio said he did not know who precisely at the organization the hackers had in their sights. Cybersecurity firms including Romania’s Bitdefender and Moscow-based Kaspersky said they have traced many of DarkHotel’s operations to East Asia - an area that has been particularly affected by the coronavirus. Specific targets have included government employees and business executives in places such as China, North Korea, Japan, and the United States. Costin Raiu, head of global research and analysis at Kaspersky, could not confirm that DarkHotel was responsible for the WHO attack but said the same malicious web infrastructure had also been used to target other healthcare and humanitarian organizations in recent weeks. “At times like this, any information about cures or tests or vaccines relating to coronavirus would be priceless and the priority of any intelligence organization of an affected country,” he said.

REUTERS/Raphael SatterOfficials and cybersecurity experts have warned that hackers of all stripes are seeking to capitalize on international concern over the spread of the coronavirus. Urbelis said he has tracked thousands of coronavirus-themed web sites being set up daily, many of them obviously malicious. “It’s still around 2,000 a day,” he said. “I have never seen anything like this.” Additional reporting by Hyonhee Shin in Seoul; Editing by Chris Sanders and Edward TobinOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n",

      "BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s desire to rapidly reopen the economy despite signs the coronavirus is still spreading may backfire, with higher deaths and citizens remaining fearful of going out, some investors said. FILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 19, 2020. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File PhotoU.S. markets have been roiled by the spread of the virus in the country and as states have shut parts of their economies.  Trump said on Monday that at the end of a 15-day shutdown period, which would run to the end of the month, “we will make a decision as to which way we want to go.”  Last week, Trump urged Americans to halt most social activities for 15 days. It is unclear what power Trump actually has to simply turn the economy back on by executive order. News of Trump reopening the U.S. economy anytime soon would not be taken well by investors, who remain anxious about the coronavirus’ uncertain trajectory and its economic toll, said Axel Merk, chief investment officer of Merk Investments.  “Markets will react badly because they have learned that this approach doesn’t work,” Merk said. “From a medical point of view, you have to break the exponential growth and you do that with shelter in place policies.” The S&P 500 Index .SPX sank 3% on Monday. It is down more than 30% from its Feb. 19 peak and is at levels not seen since the end of 2016, giving up nearly all of its gains from before Trump was elected.  BLEAK ESTIMATES Initial estimates of the pandemic’s economic fallout have grown bleaker in recent days.  U.S. unemployment could hit 30% and second-quarter economic output could be half the norm, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said.  Jennifer Pline, head of wealth management for Cambridge Trust in Boston, said it is too soon to judge whether to reopen the economy just yet.  “As we’re just starting to close things down fairly tightly, we need to wait a while until we get more traction and less contagion with the virus.” The cost of a mistake could be deadly. A March 16 study by Imperial College in London predicts 2.2 million deaths in the United States in an unmitigated epidemic, with critical care bed capacity exceeded as early as the second week in April. Economists at Northwestern University and Berlin’s Freie University estimated an “optimal containment policy” in the United States would deepen the subsequent recession but save 600,000 lives.     Ellis Phifer, market strategist for Raymond James in Memphis, Tenn. said he has struggled with the question of whether it would be best to reopen parts of the economy. “It’s really hard to determine which costs more,” Phifer said of the dueling approaches of lifting restrictions sooner or later. On balance, he would be inclined to follow the advice of public health experts like Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who have largely advocated for more restrictions.  TESTING KEY     In an interview last week, Richmond Federal Reserve president Thomas Barkin said any call to try to resume normal economic activity will depend on widespread testing quick enough that businesses can establish protocols to ensure worker and customer safety.  David Kotok, chairman & chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors, said what is imperative is to get accurate antibody tests, and to read the recovery rate as well as confirmed cases and deaths. “I don’t think the market will get the economic growth if people are dying all over the place,” said Kotok.   Others thought that the more important thing would be to get the economy back open.  “You leave this USA shut for another 60 days and you may have no economy or healthcare left,” said John Lekas at Leader Capital.   Rob Arnott, founder of asset manager Research Affiliates said the toll of job losses and other economic hardship that may stem from shutdowns and other measures could potentially be more harmful than the virus itself.  “Our way of handling this will kill a lot more people than it saves,” said Arnott.  But now the measures are taken and the population is fearful, there may be no going back.  Gregory Daco, Chief U.S, Economist at Oxford Economics, said even if the lockdowns were lifted, “businesses and households would remain very cautious, and financial intermediation would remain under stress... And, with the rest of the world under lockdown, you would presumably further alienate yourself.” Reporting by Ross Kerber, Megan Davies, Ira Iosebashvili, Noel Randewich, Howard Schneider; writing by Megan Davies; editing by Lincoln Feast.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n"

      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate could pass a $2 trillion coronavirus economic stimulus package as soon as Tuesday, negotiators said, insisting they had made significant progress despite failing so far to reach a bipartisan deal on the sweeping legislation. FILE PHOTO: White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin walk to a meeting during negotiations on a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) relief package on Capitol in Washington, U.S., March 23, 2020.  REUTERS/Joshua RobertsSteven Mnuchin, President Donald Trump’s treasury secretary, said he would return to the Capitol for more talks on Tuesday, after a day of negotiations ended at midnight without an agreement. Neither Mnuchin nor Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer would provide details, but both were optimistic. “That’s the expectation, that we will finish it tomorrow and hopefully vote on it tomorrow,” Schumer told reporters. Republicans, Democrats and top Trump aides had negotiated for days over the package, which would be the third and largest passed to address the crisis if it is backed by both the Republican-majority Senate and Democratic-majority House of Representatives. To become law, the measure must be signed by Trump. Mnuchin said he spoke to the president at least 10 times during the marathon negotiating session on Monday. Democrats twice blocked attempts to advance a Republican version of the bill as negotiations on a bipartisan measure continued. Democrats said the Republican plan did not provide enough money for states and hospitals, lacked sufficient aid for unemployed Americans and did not include adequate supervision of a massive fund to aid big businesses. The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 550 people in the United States and sickened more than 43,800, shuttered thousands of businesses, thrown millions out of work and led state governors to order about 100 million people - nearly a third of the nation’s population - to stay at home. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was consulted in the talks, introduced her own $2.5 trillion counterproposal to the Republican plan as the negotiations continued. It was not clear early on Tuesday whether Pelosi supported the bipartisan plan in the works in the Senate. Trump’s administration has launched a major push for action to blunt the economic impact - and steep stock market decline - from the pandemic, after Trump spent weeks dismissing the risks. While details of the emerging bipartisan bill were not available, it is expected to provide financial aid for Americans out of work because of the virus and help for struggling industries such as airlines.  Republicans normally hold a slim 53-47 majority in the Senate, meaning they need Democratic support to garner the 60 votes required to advance most legislation.  But the coronavirus has trimmed their ranks, giving Democrats even more leverage. Republican Senator Rand Paul has tested positive for coronavirus and four other Republicans are also unable to vote because they were exposed to Paul or others with the virus.

      "ATHENS/TOKYO (Reuters) - A decision on whether to postpone this year’s Tokyo Olympics for the first time in the Games’ modern history will come in days, sources said on Tuesday, as global clamor made a delay look inevitable because of the coronavirus crisis.  The July 24-Aug. 9 Olympics have been the last major sporting event left standing in coming months as the epidemic put most of the world in virtual lockdown.  The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Japan’s repeated insistence that the event would go ahead as scheduled - and then their weekend announcement of a lengthy, one-month consultation over possible postponement - perplexed many.   With billions of dollars and political prestige riding on the event, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and IOC President Thomas Bach were to talk by phone at 1100 GMT on Tuesday. Japan’s Sankei newspaper said the government was negotiating with the Olympic body to postpone the Games for up to a year, echoing comments by former IOC board member Dick Pound.    Sources within the Olympic movement told Reuters a decision would come in days, possibly before the planned launch of a scaled-down torch relay on Thursday. “Heartbroken but not surprised,” said twice Olympic champion swimmer Cate Campbell, whose nation Australia withdrew from the summer Games even before a formal postponement announcement.  “To be honest, I’m left reeling and feeling a little lost. But the goal posts haven’t disappeared - just shifted. It’s time to recalibrate and fire up for the next challenge.” The Olympics have never been delayed in their 124-year modern history, though they were canceled altogether in 1916, 1940 and 1944 during the two world wars. Major Cold War boycotts disrupted the Moscow and Los Angeles Games in 1980 and 1984. Pressure on the IOC had been accelerating fast in recent days, with Canada, like Australia, saying it would not participate if the Games went ahead. Related CoverageJapan PM Abe, U.S. Trump to hold phone meeting on Olympics: KyodoOlympics: Athletes would have liked quicker decision on delay - German confederationSee more stories Other nations have pressed hard for a postponement and a quick decision by the Olympic body to end uncertainty. “I AM RELIEVED”  Athletes, though sad, were mainly in agreement with a delay, given health risks and disruption to their training as gyms, stadia and swimming pools shut down around the world.  “I have ridden not just a rollercoaster but the entire theme park of emotions,” Keesja Gofers, part of the Australian women’s water polo team, said on Instagram. “I am relieved. Athletes around the world will now have the chance at a proper preparation and the Olympics can, on whatever date they are held, continue to be a coming together of the world’s best at their best.” The coronavirus outbreak has raged around the world, infecting nearly 380,000 people, killing more than 16,500 and wrecking sports events from the soccer Euros to Formula One. “Even if the current significant health concerns could be alleviated by late summer, the enormous disruptions to the training environment, doping controls and qualification process can’t be overcome in a satisfactory manner,” the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee said. The United States is by far the most successful nation in the history of the modern summer Games, while the rights deal with American broadcaster NBC to televise the Olympics represents from 50% to 70% of the IOC’s total annual revenues. “Today the Games are not the priority, the priority is health, and that is how the world of sports contributes to that international solidarity,” Tony Estanguet, head of the Paris 2024 Olympics organizing committee and an IOC member, told France Info radio, predicting a delay. Japan and the IOC have said calling off the Games entirely is not an option, but a delay would present major logistical difficulties given the crowded global sporting calendar and complex commercial considerations.

Postponement would be a massive blow for hosts Japan, which has pumped in more than $12 billion of investment, while huge sums are also at stake for sponsors and broadcasters.    But a poll showed about 70% of the Japanese think a delay is appropriate.

      "(Reuters) - German molecular testing company Qiagen NV (QIA.DE) said on Tuesday it has begun shipping its diagnostic test for COVID-19 to the United States. The test kit, QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel, requires less than one minute for sample preparation and can deliver results in about one hour, the company said. Shipments come under a new policy laid out by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration earlier this month to help accelerate the availability of coronavirus diagnostic tests, developed by laboratories and commercial manufacturers during the public health emergency. The company intends to submit an application for the related Emergency Use Authorization to the FDA this week, Qiagen said.  The test kit can differentiate the coronavirus from 20 other respiratory infections in patients who may have similar symptoms, in a single test run of about one hour. Qiagen, which is being bought by Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO.N) in an $11.5 billion deal, has already received ‘CE’ marking, a kind of fit-for-use certificate, for the diagnostic test in Europe on Wednesday.

      "MILAN/MADRID/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Corrado Sforza Fogliani is on the frontlines of European efforts to keep the region’s economy alive amid the coronavirus pandemic. FILE PHOTO: The financial district is photographed on early evening in Frankfurt, Germany, January 29, 2019.  REUTERS/Kai PfaffenbachHis small cooperative bank, Banca di Piacenza, in Italy’s virus-ravaged north, has been flooded with applications from customers seeking loan extensions, debt relief and renewal of credit lines. Buried in paperwork and with Rome and banking lobbies still at odds over who should be on the hook for defaults when a six-month debt holiday ends, Banca di Piacenza’s loan officers have only been able to process a fraction of the 1,000 applications they have received. It’s a scenario playing out in banks across the region — default fears and bureaucratic hurdles slowing down what is meant to be a swift infusion of cash for hard-pressed businesses — and it threatens Europe’s efforts to rescue its flatlining economy.   “The risk is that once we get through all this red tape the horse won’t drink because it is no longer able to,” Fogliani, Banca di Piacenza’s executive chairman, said. Faced with its worst crisis since the second world war, Europe is relying on banks to funnel a wall of money to businesses as countries impose lockdowns to stop the spread of the virus, snarling supply chains and decimating revenues. Lenders’ funding costs have been slashed, capital requirements have been relaxed and over 1 trillion euros has been pledged in loan guarantees and payment supports. But for some European banks, which are still grappling with the legacy of the last financial crisis, the virus outbreak risks derailing their recovery. Even with government guarantees, banks will still have to assume some risk of default which, on top of negative interest rates, will eat into already wafer-thin profit margins. Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest lender, which had finally been making progress on its turnaround, warned on Friday that the virus may mean it misses its targets. And while passing on interest rate cuts is straight forward, making snap decisions on customer creditworthiness, hard to do at the best of times, is especially difficult when lenders are facing a deluge of applications and a depleted workforce logging on from home. The range of challenges poses a threat to Europe’s banks, whose share prices have already plumbed record lows, the companies they serve, and the broader European economy. “I see the situation as a slow-moving systemic financial crisis. It is so slow-moving that you almost can watch it coming,” said Jan Pieter Krahnen, professor of finance at Goethe University Frankfurt. HAND OUT THE MONEY In Spain, where virus deaths have surpassed 2,000, there is confusion about how much lenders must share in the burden of 100 billion euros in state-backed credit lines. Banks are pushing for the state to guarantee on average 80% of the loans and for it to apply to both existing and new loans. Spain’s Economy Minister Nadia Calvino said the government would discuss details of the state guarantees at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.  To encourage banks to provide a lifeline to businesses running out of cash, Italy’s government is working on a guarantee covering 90% of new credit.  Germany, whose export-dependent economy is highly exposed to the supply chain problems caused by the coronavirus, is offering unlimited funds to companies through its KfW bank, which was founded to finance the nation’s rebuilding after World War II. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank said on Monday they had received thousands of queries from mainly small and medium-sized business clients for the KfW credits.  “The phones are ringing off the hook,” said Stefan Bender, head of Deutsche’s corporate bank in Germany. Amid the promise of funds, Thomas Giessing, head of a local savings bank in Heinsberg on the western-most edge of Germany, says he is fielding a surge of requests for debt relief from local businesses. The region has been the hardest hit in Germany by the coronavirus. Some of its manufacturing firms have been unable to ship their goods or access raw materials because of supply chain problems and local tradesman such as plumbers and electricians have found it difficult to get work because of contagion fears. Giessing, a former Olympic runner, understands that speed is required but after years of low margins caused by ultra-easy monetary policy, he is still unsure of what he can offer because the loans are only partially guaranteed by the government. “This has left its mark on all sectors, big and small...All of us want to be able to supply companies with liquidity,” he said. KfW began accepting applications on Monday and said it should be able to process small loans in minutes, while loans of more than 10 million euros will take a week to 10 days. But some bankers fear it will weeks, not days, for credits to process.    That is too slow, said Bettina Stark-Watzinger, a member of Germany’s Bundestag finance committee. “Flooding the market with money is not enough. You need the credit demand, and you can only have credit demand if you can hand out the money,” she said.

      "본문 : \n",
      "BEIJING (Reuters) - Publishers of three U.S. newspapers urged China on Tuesday to reverse a decision to force out about a dozen of their American journalists, saying in an open letter that the expulsions come at a time of “shared crisis” for the world. China announced on March 18 it was revoking the press accreditations of all American journalists in the China bureaus of the three newspapers that were due to expire at the end of 2020, effectively expelling them. “We strongly urge the Chinese government to reverse its decision to force the Americans working for our news organizations to leave,” the publishers of News Corp’s (NWSA.O) Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post and the New York Times (NYT.N) said. The decision “uniquely damaging and reckless” as the world is fighting a global coronavirus pandemic, they said. “Perhaps more than any major news event in modern history, this moment underscores the urgent importance of both probing, accurate, on-the-ground reporting from the centers of the pandemic and of sharing the information.” The expulsions were the latest escalation in a dispute with the United States over media freedom and access, which last month saw the United States require that Chinese state media register as foreign embassies. China then expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters - two Americans and an Australian - after the paper published an opinion column calling China the “real sick man of Asia”. The United States then cut the number of journalists allowed to work at four major Chinese state media outlets there from 160 to 100, citing a “deepening crackdown” on independent reporting in China.  China’s Foreign Ministry has said its measures are “necessary” and “reciprocal” against “escalating discrimination and oppression against Chinese media” by the United States.

      "CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. lawmakers on Monday proposed giving struggling U.S. airlines and contractors $40 billion in cash grants that would not have to be paid back but require significant new environmental, labor and other conditions. American Airlines passenger planes crowd a runway where they are parked due to flight reductions made to slow the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), at Tulsa International Airport in Tulsa, Oklahoma, U.S. March 23, 2020. REUTERS/Nick OxfordThe U.S. House of Representatives bill, which provides $2.5 trillion in stimulus and assistance to the U.S. economy in the face of the coronavirus outbreak, would award $37 billion in grants to airlines and $3 billion in grants to employees of ground-support and catering contractors. Airlines could also receive $21 billion in loans that would be at zero percent financing for the first year. Airlines for America, a trade group representing major airlines, told Congress in a term sheet Monday seen by Reuters that if passenger and cargo carriers got $29 billion in grants it would “permit us to save hundreds of thousands of jobs and preserve service to every community currently served in the United States for a period of time.” The term sheet said that if Congress added conditions to government loans it could “render the loans unusable, because the process provided to businesses via U.S. bankruptcy law is more attractive.” Republicans and Democrats were still struggling on Monday to reach agreement on a far-reaching coronavirus stimulus package, including the airline aid, after failing to reach a deal over the weekend. Republicans have opposed providing bailouts to the passenger and cargo carriers, proposing help in the form of $58 billion in loans and saying the government could demand stock, options or other equity as part of those loans. The House bill would also set aside $1 billion to eliminate high-polluting airplanes. It would cap chief executive pay at no more than 50 times the median pay of employees and bar stock buybacks. It would also require that “no additional aircraft heavy maintenance work is outsourced to repair stations abroad” and require airlines to have a labor union-designated director.  Airlines would have to maintain “at least $15 minimum wage for all employees or contracted workers.” Airlines receiving assistance would need to fully offset their carbon emissions starting in 2025 and reduce carbon emissions 25% by 2035 and by 50% by 2050. They would also be required to tell customers the amount of carbon emissions attributed to their flights.  Airlines made a plea over the weekend that $29 billion of $58 billion sought in assistance be in the form of cash grants. In return, they offered to make no job cuts through Aug. 31 and to accept curbs on executive pay and forgo paying dividends or stock buybacks. Airlines including United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL.N have also said they are encouraging employees to apply for voluntary unpaid leaves of absence among other measures aimed at saving costs. Globally, the number of scheduled flights last week was down more than 12% from a year ago, flight data provider OAG said, and many airlines have announced further cuts to come as demand continues to drop. Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) became the latest U.S. airline to slash its capacity by about 25% on Sunday, bringing forward and increasing cancellations that were initially due to run between April 14 and June 5. The cancellations include the suspension of all international flying until May 4, it said.

      "(Reuters) - The Trump administration is moving ahead with oil and gas lease sales in four Western states beginning on Tuesday, bucking criticism from taxpayer advocates who say the auctions should be postponed because of a meltdown in energy prices. FILE PHOTO: Pump jacks operate in front of a drilling rig in an oil field in Midland, Texas U.S. August 22, 2018. Picture taken August 22, 2018. REUTERS/Nick Oxford/File PhotoThe Bureau of Land Management is offering more than 210,000 acres (85,000 hectares) for leasing via online auctions in Wyoming, Nevada and Montana on Tuesday, and Colorado on Thursday. The largest sale is for 105 parcels covering 118,292 acres (47,871 hectares) in Wyoming, the top U.S. state for gas production on federal lands and the second-biggest for oil production, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  In Nevada, BLM will offer 45 parcels covering 70,110 acres (28,372 hectares) and in Montana it will auction eight parcels covering 5,180 acres (2,100 hectares). The Colorado sale is for 20 parcels on 18,960 acres (7,670 hectares). Drilling on federal lands is a crucial part of President Donald Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda to maximize domestic production of fossil fuels. But the industry is in crisis as countries including the United States take unprecedented steps to contain the coronavirus pandemic that has curbed demand for products such as gasoline and jet fuel. U.S. oil prices have dropped roughly half since the middle of February to about $24 a barrel. Last week, the United States held an auction for oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico that generated the lowest total of high bids for any domestic offshore auction since 2016. Earlier this month, BLM held a lease sale in Utah that received mostly minimum bids of $2 an acre. “In this environment, it is impossible for the American taxpayer to expect anywhere near a fair return on oil and gas leases,” Taxpayers for Common Sense, a federal budget watchdog organization, and Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship, a non-profit conservation group, said in a joint statement last week. Department of Interior spokesman Conner Swanson did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. Last week, he said lease sales were “being evaluated on a case-by-case basis.” BLM is a division of the Interior Department.

      "제목 : Factbox: How vulnerable is Latin America to coronavirus? Key data shed light\n",
      "본문 : \n",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The coronavirus is spreading deeper into Latin America, a region home to about 8.5% of the world’s population that many expects believe could be among the worst affected by COVID-19. A kid is pictured in the Alemao slums complex during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil March 22, 2020. REUTERS/Ricardo MoraesHeavily reliant on commodity exports, tourism and remittances, Latin America’s fragile economies and vulnerable populations are likely to suffer. JPMorgan expects a 2020 GDP contraction exceeding 2% across the region and over 3% in Colombia, Brazil and Mexico. Below, Reuters examines World Bank data that shine a light on just how vulnerable Latin America may be to the virus’ spread. AGE Although much remains unknown about COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, it appears older people are more vulnerable.  Latin America has a younger population compared to some other parts of the world. Less than 9% of its population is aged 65 and above, compared with 20% in the European Union and 16% in North America. In Sub-Saharan Africa, 3% of the population is aged 65 and over. Meanwhile, 67% of Latin America’s population is aged between 15-64, a slightly higher share than North America (66%), the EU (65%) and the world as a whole (65%). HEALTHCARE Latin America dedicates about 9% of its gross domestic product to healthcare, while the EU allocates 10%. North America spends 16.58% of its GDP on healthcare. On a per capita basis, Latin America spends nearly $700 on healthcare, compared with $3,211 in the EU and $9,326 in North America.  Latin America has 2.2 physicians per 1,000 people, slightly more than the rest of the world (1.5), but below the EU and North America, which have 3.6 and 2.6 doctors per 1,000 people, respectively.  By comparison, East Asia and the Pacific have 1.6 doctors for every 1,000 people.  Latin America has 4.7 nurses and midwives per 1,000 people, versus 3.4 per 1,000 in the rest of the world. The EU has 8.6, while North America has 8.7 per 1,0000.  Compared with other regions, Latin America has relatively few hospital beds per 1,000 people - 2.2 compared with 5.6 in the EU. The rest of the world has 2.7 per 1,000 people. In Latin America, about 14% of deaths are caused by either communicable diseases, maternal, prenatal and nutrition conditions. Although that percentage is low compared with South Asia, where 27% of deaths are attributed to such causes, it is well below the 5% in the EU and North America.  COVID-19 appears to pose a greater threat to people with pre-existing health conditions. In Latin America, nearly 10% of people between 20 and 79 have diabetes, slightly below the 10.5% in North America. In the EU, just 6.3% of that age group have diabetes, while in East Asia and the Pacific, 8.2% do.  Nearly 15% of Latin Americans aged 15 or over smoke, compared with about a fifth in North America and more than a quarter in the EU and East Asia and the Pacific.  Although the risks of coronavirus to people with HIV are not known, Latin America’s HIV infection prevalence for people aged 15-49 is the same as that of North America - 0.4%. SOCIAL ISSUES Nearly 4.5% of Latin America’s population lives on less than $1.90 a day, compared with 10% across the rest of the world, 1.3% in East Asia and the Pacific, and 7.2% in the Middle East and North America. In Sub-Saharan Africa, 42.3% of the population lives on under $1.90 a day.  Around a fifth of Latin America’s urban population lives in slums; in East Asia and the Pacific, just over a quarter does. Worldwide, nearly a third of city-dwellers lives in slums. More than half of the urban population in sub-Saharan Africa lives in shanties.  Although Latin America has some of the world’s largest cities, including Sao Paulo and Mexico City, the region has a population density of just 32 people per square kilometer. In the EU, the population density is 121 people/sq. km, while in East Asia and the Pacific it is 95/sq. km. In North America, there are 20 people per square kilometer.

REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File PhotoFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Tesla bought hospital ventilators in China and shipped them to the United States, CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday. Tesla’s purchase comes as governments across the globe appeal to automakers and aerospace companies help procure or make ventilators and other medical equipment. “China had an oversupply, so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed, Philips & Medtronic ventilators on Friday night & airshipped them to LA,” Musk said on Twitter. California Governor Gavin Newsom on Tuesday said the state would receive 1,000 ventilators from Tesla as the United States braces to deal with an influx of patients infected by the coronavirus. Authorities are hoping large-scale manufacturers can use their low-cost supply chains and digital design expertise, including 3D printing, and repurpose some factories in order to make up the expected shortfall in vital medical hardware. Carmakers have cautioned that assembling delicate medical equipment to standards adequate for use in hospital intensive care units remains a challenge.

      "CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - When panic over the coronavirus spurred a run on hand sanitizer in Cape Town, gin maker Andre Pienaar realized there was something he could do with all the waste alcohol his small distillery produces. Distiller Andre Pienaar mixes up a batch of  70 percent alcohol, a by-product of the gin making process, which he makes available as hand sanitiser to restrict the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Cape Town, South Africa, March 19, 2020. REUTERS/Mike HutchingsHe had 140 liters of the 70 percent ethanol waste - called “gin heads” in the trade - just sitting around, so he posted on social media that anyone who needed some could have it for free to turn into the hand wash at home. “The response was crazy. It was finished in three hours and there was a limit of one liter per person,” he told Reuters. He has now started selling the ethanol his Pienaar and Son Distilling Company is still producing. “There is nothing on the shelves for people other than soap at the moment. It is just another option to help protect people,” he said. Across Africa, dwindling supplies of sanitizer and surgical masks could prove a boon for entrepreneurs seeking to plug shortages. Amateur chemists in Nigeria and Kenya are mixing up hand wash, while enterprising tailors in Rwanda are sewing their own masks. Health officials warn that wearing masks in public won’t protect you from the virus, and say sanitizer only works if it’s more than 60 percent alcohol - and even then soap and water are better. But those warnings have not stopped customers flocking to Alexander Nshimiyimana, a tailor based in Kigali’s main market. He is using kitenge, a kaleidoscopic local fabric, to make masks that are not only cheaper but much prettier than the standard hospital-style ones. “It is a kind of opportunity to some people to make money. It is also (an) opportunity to innovate,” Nshimiyimana said. The continent of 1.3 billion has recorded only around 1,100 cases in 43 countries, with 39 deaths, a fraction of the more than 305,000 people infected and more than 13,000 deaths worldwide. But there are concerns that Africa’s creaky health infrastructure could be overrun as the virus spreads. “A mask will not protect you from the infection, it will protect others if you wear it from getting infected should you have symptoms. So in this respect also a piece of cloth works,” James Ayodele, spokesman of the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) Africa office. Ayodele said that the CDC also advised against making sanitizer at home because it contains alcohol at a potentially dangerous high concentration. But Moji Kusanu, a chef in Nigeria’s commercial hub of Lagos, decided to respond to an obvious shortage - after prices shot up to 1,700 naira ($5.55) for a 200ml bottle, from 200 naira before. She customized an online sanitizer recipe, which recommended mixing alcohol with aloe vera gel, by adding glycerine for extra moisturizing effect. “Sometimes, when you are out you cannot wash your hands. sanitizers can ... make a difference,” she said Additional reporting by Themistocle Hakizimana and Jackson Njehia in Kigale, Angela Ukomadu in Lagos and Giulia Paravicini in Addis Ababa; Writing by Tim Cocks; Editing by Andrew HeavensOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n",

      "BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s desire to rapidly reopen the economy despite signs the coronavirus is still spreading may backfire, with higher deaths and citizens remaining fearful of going out, some investors said. FILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 19, 2020. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File PhotoU.S. markets have been roiled by the spread of the virus in the country and as states have shut parts of their economies.  Trump said on Monday that at the end of a 15-day shutdown period, which would run to the end of the month, “we will make a decision as to which way we want to go.”  Last week, Trump urged Americans to halt most social activities for 15 days. It is unclear what power Trump actually has to simply turn the economy back on by executive order. News of Trump reopening the U.S. economy anytime soon would not be taken well by investors, who remain anxious about the coronavirus’ uncertain trajectory and its economic toll, said Axel Merk, chief investment officer of Merk Investments.  “Markets will react badly because they have learned that this approach doesn’t work,” Merk said. “From a medical point of view, you have to break the exponential growth and you do that with shelter in place policies.” The S&P 500 Index .SPX sank 3% on Monday. It is down more than 30% from its Feb. 19 peak and is at levels not seen since the end of 2016, giving up nearly all of its gains from before Trump was elected.  BLEAK ESTIMATES Initial estimates of the pandemic’s economic fallout have grown bleaker in recent days.  U.S. unemployment could hit 30% and second-quarter economic output could be half the norm, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said.  Jennifer Pline, head of wealth management for Cambridge Trust in Boston, said it is too soon to judge whether to reopen the economy just yet.  “As we’re just starting to close things down fairly tightly, we need to wait a while until we get more traction and less contagion with the virus.” The cost of a mistake could be deadly. A March 16 study by Imperial College in London predicts 2.2 million deaths in the United States in an unmitigated epidemic, with critical care bed capacity exceeded as early as the second week in April. Economists at Northwestern University and Berlin’s Freie University estimated an “optimal containment policy” in the United States would deepen the subsequent recession but save 600,000 lives.     Ellis Phifer, market strategist for Raymond James in Memphis, Tenn. said he has struggled with the question of whether it would be best to reopen parts of the economy. “It’s really hard to determine which costs more,” Phifer said of the dueling approaches of lifting restrictions sooner or later. On balance, he would be inclined to follow the advice of public health experts like Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who have largely advocated for more restrictions.  TESTING KEY     In an interview last week, Richmond Federal Reserve president Thomas Barkin said any call to try to resume normal economic activity will depend on widespread testing quick enough that businesses can establish protocols to ensure worker and customer safety.  David Kotok, chairman & chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors, said what is imperative is to get accurate antibody tests, and to read the recovery rate as well as confirmed cases and deaths. “I don’t think the market will get the economic growth if people are dying all over the place,” said Kotok.   Others thought that the more important thing would be to get the economy back open.  “You leave this USA shut for another 60 days and you may have no economy or healthcare left,” said John Lekas at Leader Capital.   Rob Arnott, founder of asset manager Research Affiliates said the toll of job losses and other economic hardship that may stem from shutdowns and other measures could potentially be more harmful than the virus itself.  “Our way of handling this will kill a lot more people than it saves,” said Arnott.  But now the measures are taken and the population is fearful, there may be no going back.  Gregory Daco, Chief U.S, Economist at Oxford Economics, said even if the lockdowns were lifted, “businesses and households would remain very cautious, and financial intermediation would remain under stress... And, with the rest of the world under lockdown, you would presumably further alienate yourself.” Reporting by Ross Kerber, Megan Davies, Ira Iosebashvili, Noel Randewich, Howard Schneider; writing by Megan Davies; editing by Lincoln Feast.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n"

      "ROME (Reuters) - The death toll from an outbreak of coronavirus in Italy rose by 602 on Monday, the smallest increase for four days, while the number of new cases also slowed, raising hope that the most aggressive phase of the epidemic may be passing. Medical workers in protective suits check a document as they treat patients suffering with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in an intensive care unit at the Casalpalocco hospital, a hospital in Rome that has been dedicated to treating cases of the disease, Italy, March 24, 2020. REUTERS/Guglielmo MangiapaneThe Civil Protection Agency said the number of fatalities from the month-old contagion stood at 6,077, while confirmed cases totaled 63,927, an increase of 4,789 over the past 24 hours — the smallest rise for five days. “Today is perhaps the first positive day we have had in this hard, very tough month,” said Giulio Gallera, the top health official in the northern region of Lombardy, which has been hardest hit by the outbreak. “It is not the time to sing victory, but we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” he told reporters. However, there was also a significant fall in the number of tests carried out, and the head of Italy’s national health institute, Silvio Brusaferro, said it was too soon to say if the recent decline in daily deaths and new cases would continue. Unions in Lombardy earlier announced they would strike on Wednesday to protect the health of their workers, saying a government decree temporarily shutting businesses due to the coronavirus emergency contained too many loopholes. Italy has suffered the world’s deadliest outbreak of the respiratory pandemic, with 62% of the fatalities registered in Lombardy, the country’s most populous and wealthy region. A government decree signed on Sunday said all but  “essential” businesses must close until April 3 and set out a long list of exceptions deemed vital to keep Italy’s supply chain running.  The Lombardy branches of the three main metalworkers unions, FIOM, FIM and UILM, said the list “has been excessively extended, covering areas of dubious importance” and allowing firms “excessive discretion” to apply for exemptions.  Related CoverageCoronavirus death toll in Italy's Lombardy rises by around 320 in a day: sourceSOUTHERN WORRIES In a joint statement, they trio of unions said workers in all factories not directly linked to the beleaguered health sector would down tools. Lombardy’s chemical workers said they would also stay home on March 25. “The decree allows a lot of firms to remain open, many without the proper guarantees and safety norms, creating conditions not agreed with us and fanning a lot of concern among workers,” said Paolo Pirani, national head of the UILTEC chemical and textile workers’ union. Bank workers threatened a nationwide walkout, saying they were forced to work in unsafe conditions without masks, gloves and sufficient amounts of antiseptic gels. Several banks have already temporarily closed branches to sanitize them. Many of the country’s most prominent companies have already suspended their output in Italy, including eyeware manufacturer Luxottica, luxury carmaker Ferrari and tyre maker Pirelli.    The Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler told employees on Monday it would halt production in all European and North American plants and help with the production of masks during the coronavirus emergency, a union representative said. The head of employers’ lobby Confindustria warned about the economic impact of the factory closures. By shutting 70% of the country’s output, Italy will lose 100 billion euros ($107.63 billion) a month, he told Sky Italia in a television interview. Italy’s northern regions have borne the overwhelming brunt of the crisis but there is concern the virus could spread into the poorer south where health systems are less well-equipped. The first death was recorded on Monday in the southern region of Basilicata, meaning all Italy’s 20 regions have now registered fatalities. Slideshow (13 Images)Sebastiano Musumeci, the regional president of Sicily, protested on Monday that many non-residents were arriving on the southern island on car ferries.  “The national government must intervene because we Sicilians are not willing to be slaughtered like cattle,” he said.

      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate could pass a $2 trillion coronavirus economic stimulus package as soon as Tuesday, negotiators said, insisting they had made significant progress despite failing so far to reach a bipartisan deal on the sweeping legislation. FILE PHOTO: White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin walk to a meeting during negotiations on a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) relief package on Capitol in Washington, U.S., March 23, 2020.  REUTERS/Joshua RobertsSteven Mnuchin, President Donald Trump’s treasury secretary, said he would return to the Capitol for more talks on Tuesday, after a day of negotiations ended at midnight without an agreement. Neither Mnuchin nor Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer would provide details, but both were optimistic. “That’s the expectation, that we will finish it tomorrow and hopefully vote on it tomorrow,” Schumer told reporters. Republicans, Democrats and top Trump aides had negotiated for days over the package, which would be the third and largest passed to address the crisis if it is backed by both the Republican-majority Senate and Democratic-majority House of Representatives. To become law, the measure must be signed by Trump. Mnuchin said he spoke to the president at least 10 times during the marathon negotiating session on Monday. Democrats twice blocked attempts to advance a Republican version of the bill as negotiations on a bipartisan measure continued. Democrats said the Republican plan did not provide enough money for states and hospitals, lacked sufficient aid for unemployed Americans and did not include adequate supervision of a massive fund to aid big businesses. The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 550 people in the United States and sickened more than 43,800, shuttered thousands of businesses, thrown millions out of work and led state governors to order about 100 million people - nearly a third of the nation’s population - to stay at home. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was consulted in the talks, introduced her own $2.5 trillion counterproposal to the Republican plan as the negotiations continued. It was not clear early on Tuesday whether Pelosi supported the bipartisan plan in the works in the Senate. Trump’s administration has launched a major push for action to blunt the economic impact - and steep stock market decline - from the pandemic, after Trump spent weeks dismissing the risks. While details of the emerging bipartisan bill were not available, it is expected to provide financial aid for Americans out of work because of the virus and help for struggling industries such as airlines.  Republicans normally hold a slim 53-47 majority in the Senate, meaning they need Democratic support to garner the 60 votes required to advance most legislation.  But the coronavirus has trimmed their ranks, giving Democrats even more leverage. Republican Senator Rand Paul has tested positive for coronavirus and four other Republicans are also unable to vote because they were exposed to Paul or others with the virus.

Shoppers queue to stock up on groceries at a Pick n Pay store during a nationwide lockdown of 21 days to try to contain the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Johannesburg, South Africa, March 24, 2020. REUTERS/Siphiwe SibekoPresident Cyril Ramaphosa announced the 21-day lockdown in an address to the nation on Monday, saying Africa’s most advanced economy needed to escalate its response to curb the spread of the outbreak. South Africa has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in sub-Saharan Africa, and public health experts are worried that the virus could overwhelm the health system if infection rates rise steeply. Health officials are working to expand the country’s coronavirus testing capacity and develop a plan to ensure there are enough intensive care beds with respirators. “The numbers, we mustn’t be shocked when we see them increase. But these measures if we all work together must turn the curve around,” Health Minister Zweli Mkhize told a televised news conference, saying South Africa could reach an inflection point in its infection curve two or three weeks after its lockdown restrictions enter into force. Two patients are in intensive care, but there have been no deaths from coronavirus in the country, Mkhize said. Agriculture Minister Thoko Didiza said the government had taken steps to ensure the lockdown would not affect food security. “There is no need to embark on panic-buying, the country has enough food supplies,” Didiza said, adding the government would be monitoring food retailers to ensure sellers do not inflate prices. Aviation company Comair, a franchise partner of British Airways (BA), said it was suspending all flights it operates for BA and services on the kulula.com low-cost airline from Thursday until April 19.

      "본문 : \n",
      "BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese consumer finance companies are rushing to fund lending by selling asset-backed securities (ABS) as they join banks in a government-led campaign to boost consumption in an economy ravaged by the coronavirus outbreak.  Home Credit, one of the oldest consumer finance companies in China, launched the sale of 2.5 billion yuan of ABS backed by consumer loans on Tuesday, in the biggest ABS deal since the coronavirus outbreak shut large parts of China’s economy. Asset-backed securities allow lenders to move loans off their balance sheets, freeing them up to extend fresh credit.  The firm, controlled by Czech businessman Petr Kellner, said it has another 15 billion yuan worth of ABS in the pipeline for sale. The rising sales of consumer ABS come as demand for credit has been hit badly by the economic downturn, but officials have pinpointed consumer lenders as a key lever in rebooting consumption.  Beijing is “counting on” consumer credit to help consumption recovery, said Ye Yanfei, director general of the policy research department from China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) on Sunday.  Banks including China Merchants Bank (600036.SS) and China Guangfa Bank have lowered the rates they offer on consumer loans and added special offers for credit card users. Wang Jing, analyst with Golden Credit Rating International, predicted that deal size of ABS will continue to grow in 2020 because of the government-led push to boost consumer credit.  “Consumer credit is the only way out,” said Dexter Hsu, a Taiwan-based analyst with Macquarie Capital, who added that lenders with higher-margin consumer credit franchises could be better positioned in the current environment than larger banks whose income will be hurt more by rate cuts.  There are, however, concerns that ABS could fall out of favor with investors if weakening credit quality increased bad loan rates.  Credit rating agency Moody’s Investors Service warned last week that it expected the performance of auto loan ABS - a big segment in China’s ABS market - to weaken as economic growth slowed.

      "LONDON (Reuters) - Global equities rebounded almost 2% on Tuesday, off near four-year lows, and the dollar slipped as investors pinned hopes on unprecedented stimulus steps by the U.S Federal Reserve and other policymakers to ease strains in financial markets. FILE PHOTO: Pedestrians wearing face masks walk near an overpass with an electronic board showing stock information, following an outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), at Lujiazui financial district in Shanghai, China March 17, 2020. REUTERS/Aly SongWhile the measures such as the Fed’s offer of unlimited bond-buying won’t immediately mitigate the economic devastation inflicted by the coronavirus outbreak, they will launch more dollars into world markets, allowing companies, funds and banks to access cash to pay creditors, supplier and end-investors. The prospect had not cheered Wall Street for very long on Monday, with losses of 2-3% on major indexes, but the mood improved on Tuesday, possibly as many other central banks and governments looked set to join the fray. Wall Street futures pointed to stocks opening 4% higher, while a pan-European equity index also rallied a similar amount. “Today there is a strong recovery connected to the move that the Fed has introduced this massive weapon,” said Francois Savary, CIO of wealth manager Prime Partners, noting the Fed had needed to resolve funding markets seize-ups as a priority. “The key issue at the end of the day is that we need to deal with a credit markets that is completely closed. First they needed to stop this increase in bond yields... second, they needed to make sure that there is a return of liquidity in the credit then it will be equities - in that sequence.” The Fed will not only buy unlimited amounts of assets but also expand its mandate to corporate and municipal bonds and backstop a series of other measures that analysts estimate will deliver $4 trillion-plus in loans to non-financial firms. There were also signs of progress in Congress on a $2 trillion U.S. stimulus deal, which Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin hoped was “very close”. Other countries are unveiling their own measures - South Korea’s ravaged market climbed 8.6% after the government doubled a planned economic rescue package to 100 trillion won ($80 billion). In China, mainland stocks posted their biggest gain in three weeks with a rise of almost 3% while Japan’s Nikkei soared 7%, its biggest daily rise since Feb 2016.  Not everyone was optimistic the buoyant mood would last noting, for instance, that global coronavirus infections now top 350,000 with scores of countries in lockdown. China too posted a  rise in new infections brought in from abroad.  (Graphic: China's coronavirus cases JPG, here)     “Markets are continuing to bounce up on the latest policy announcements and then sliding back down as the economic reality of the situation re-emerges,” Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said. Still, the plan calmed nerves in bond markets, where yields on two-year Treasuries hit their lowest since 2013. Ten-year yields were at 0.8339%, from last week’s peak of 1.28%. Yields inched higher on Tuesday as equities rallied. ALL ABOUT THE ECONOMY Just how much the virus is ravaging the global economy is evident in a series of growth forecast downgrades and advance readings of purchasing managers indexes (PMI) across the world’s biggest economies. German activity plunged to the lowest since the 2009 crisis, driven by a record services contraction, while French activity hit all-time lows. Japan posted its biggest-ever services decline. “Economies around the world are going offline and that is devastating for economic activity, it’s creating the most robust dislocation in financial markets in living memory,” said George Boubouras, head of research at K2 Asset Management in Melbourne. For now however, the prospect of massive Fed funding pushed the greenback 0.5% lower against rivals, off three-year peaks. It fell similarly to the yen and slumped 1% versus the euro. Commodity and emerging market currencies also benefited, with the Australian dollar up almost 2% to $0.59315 and well off 17-year lows. There was some relief on the market volatility front too. A gauge of expected euro-dollar swings eased below 12%, from above 14% on Monday, and a measure of U.S. equity volatility slipped to one-week lows around 57 points.

      "LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar slipped for a second consecutive day on Tuesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve unveiled fresh measures to supply precious liquidity into funding markets, sending risky currencies such as the Australian dollar soaring. FILE PHOTO: One hundred dollar notes are seen in this photo illustration at a bank in Seoul, South Korea, January 9, 2013. REUTERS/Lee Jae-Won/Illustration/File PhotoThe Fed announced unlimited quantitative easing and programs to support credit markets on Monday in a drastic bid to backstop an economy reeling from emergency restrictions on commerce to fight the coronavirus. Against a basket of its rivals =USD, the dollar fell 0.5% to 101.52, down more than 1% from Monday’s highs and having hit a more than three-year high of 102.99 on Friday. “The dollar funding conditions are easing slightly compared with a week ago, though I wouldn’t say things are normal. While the Fed is pumping dollars, we still need to wait and see if that money will flow to every corner of the economy,” said Koichi Kobayashi, chief manager of forex at Mitsubishi Trust Bank. While the Fed’s latest measures were seen to have effectively broken the spreading freeze in the dollar funding markets in the short-term, the shock to the real economy is expected to last for a far longer period with latest PMI data offering a glimpse of the pain. Japan posted its biggest ever services sector decline and factory activity shrank at its fastest in a decade, consistent with a 4% economic contraction this year. The picture in Australia was similar.  Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX and commodity research at Commerzbank said in a note that as more economies enact draconian measures to lock down their economies, the global economy would be massively constrained in the near future and markets could quickly turn back into risk-off mode. But in early London trading, battered currencies rallied. The euro gained 1% to $1.0834 EUR=EBS, bouncing back from a near three-year low of $1.0636 in the previous session.

      "SYDNEY/MONTREAL (Reuters) - The pandemic is taking its toll on aerospace manufacturing, with Boeing Co (BA.N) saying it would halt production of most widebody jets and Airbus SE (AIR.PA) restarting only partial output after a four-day shutdown as suppliers cut jobs. A cleaner works at Hong Kong International Airport, following the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Hong Kong, China March 24, 2020. REUTERS/Tyrone SiuWith airlines unable to fly because of a collapse of demand over fears of contagion, reinforced by air travel restrictions, planemakers and their suppliers are under pressure to save cash to ride out a squeeze in liquidity. Moody’s cut its outlook for the aerospace and defense industry to negative from stable and warned that even when markets recover, the damaged balance sheets of most airlines would hurt demand for new aircraft. Global passenger capacity fell 35% last week, the worst since the start of the crisis, according to data from airline schedules firm OAG, which said deeper cuts were likely in the coming weeks.  More than 2,500 planes have already been grounded this year, data from Cirium shows, with taxiways, maintenance hangars and even runways at major global airports turning into giant parking lots.  On Tuesday, Asian jet fuel refining margins - the difference in value between raw crude and the refined product - turned negative for the first time in over a decade, suggesting there was no recovery timeframe in sight for the aviation industry. Large U.S. carriers have drafted plans for a possible halt in U.S. passenger air traffic, four officials said on condition of anonymity, though there is no plan in place and U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he was not considering a domestic travel ban. Boeing faces the shutdown of key assembly lines for the second time in a year after being forced to halt production of its grounded 737 MAX aircraft in January. Production of long-haul jets like the 787 and 777 in Washington state will pause for 14 days starting Wednesday, forcing the world’s largest industrial building, the giant Boeing wide-body plant at Everett north of Seattle, to fall silent for the first time in recent memory. Related CoverageRyanair will not operate flights in April or MayWizz Air suspends all flights to and from Varna over coronavirusAs the crisis deepens, U.S. lawmakers are considering changing some of about $58 billion in proposed emergency loans to the airline industry to cash grants to cover payroll costs, four people familiar with the matter said. Brazil’s Embraer SA (EMBR3.SA), the world’s third-largest aircraft maker, said on Sunday it would furlough all non-essential workers in Brazil where it makes regional jets, and further measures could be announced later this week. Joining the list of temporary shutdowns is Bombardier, which is suspending Canadian production of business jets, according to a source familiar with the matter. Airbus had called for strong government support for airlines and suppliers but stopped short of calling for direct aid for the company, which has secured an extra 15 billion euros ($16.14 billion) of commercial credit lines. The European planemaker has, however, told officials privately that it may need European government help if the crisis lasts for several months, Reuters reported last week. Norwegian Air (NWC.OL), which has grounded most of its aircraft and temporarily laid off 90% of staff, said on Tuesday it secured an initial cash infusion of 300 million Norwegian crowns ($26.6 million) from the government. Industry executives said the biggest source of alarm was the global supply chain of thousands of suppliers who would be severely hurt by abrupt stop-start movements in plane output. Many are already severely stressed by the year-long 737 MAX grounding. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers on Monday said in a letter to Congress that more than 500,000 U.S. aerospace production jobs could be in jeopardy and called for a relief package that included provisions to protect against layoffs. Engine maker GE Aviation (GE.N) announced plans to cut its U.S. workforce by around 10%, according to a letter to staff.

German aircraft engine maker MTU Aero Engines (MTXGn.DE) said it would shut output in some European plants for three weeks. The shutdowns are designed in part to allow for deep cleaning and the re-organisation of factory workers, who must avoid working in clusters, slowing output.

      "CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. lawmakers on Monday proposed giving struggling U.S. airlines and contractors $40 billion in cash grants that would not have to be paid back but require significant new environmental, labor and other conditions. American Airlines passenger planes crowd a runway where they are parked due to flight reductions made to slow the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), at Tulsa International Airport in Tulsa, Oklahoma, U.S. March 23, 2020. REUTERS/Nick OxfordThe U.S. House of Representatives bill, which provides $2.5 trillion in stimulus and assistance to the U.S. economy in the face of the coronavirus outbreak, would award $37 billion in grants to airlines and $3 billion in grants to employees of ground-support and catering contractors. Airlines could also receive $21 billion in loans that would be at zero percent financing for the first year. Airlines for America, a trade group representing major airlines, told Congress in a term sheet Monday seen by Reuters that if passenger and cargo carriers got $29 billion in grants it would “permit us to save hundreds of thousands of jobs and preserve service to every community currently served in the United States for a period of time.” The term sheet said that if Congress added conditions to government loans it could “render the loans unusable, because the process provided to businesses via U.S. bankruptcy law is more attractive.” Republicans and Democrats were still struggling on Monday to reach agreement on a far-reaching coronavirus stimulus package, including the airline aid, after failing to reach a deal over the weekend. Republicans have opposed providing bailouts to the passenger and cargo carriers, proposing help in the form of $58 billion in loans and saying the government could demand stock, options or other equity as part of those loans. The House bill would also set aside $1 billion to eliminate high-polluting airplanes. It would cap chief executive pay at no more than 50 times the median pay of employees and bar stock buybacks. It would also require that “no additional aircraft heavy maintenance work is outsourced to repair stations abroad” and require airlines to have a labor union-designated director.  Airlines would have to maintain “at least $15 minimum wage for all employees or contracted workers.” Airlines receiving assistance would need to fully offset their carbon emissions starting in 2025 and reduce carbon emissions 25% by 2035 and by 50% by 2050. They would also be required to tell customers the amount of carbon emissions attributed to their flights.  Airlines made a plea over the weekend that $29 billion of $58 billion sought in assistance be in the form of cash grants. In return, they offered to make no job cuts through Aug. 31 and to accept curbs on executive pay and forgo paying dividends or stock buybacks. Airlines including United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL.N have also said they are encouraging employees to apply for voluntary unpaid leaves of absence among other measures aimed at saving costs. Globally, the number of scheduled flights last week was down more than 12% from a year ago, flight data provider OAG said, and many airlines have announced further cuts to come as demand continues to drop. Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) became the latest U.S. airline to slash its capacity by about 25% on Sunday, bringing forward and increasing cancellations that were initially due to run between April 14 and June 5. The cancellations include the suspension of all international flying until May 4, it said.

Heleno is now one of nearly two dozen confirmed coronavirus cases that have surfaced among Brazilians who traveled to Florida earlier this month to hobnob with U.S. officials. Bolsonaro and senior aides met with U.S. President Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, while a larger contingent gathered with lawmakers and business leaders at a Miami hotel and other events. Some 22 Brazilians who made the journey have confirmed they have tested positive, through public statements or social media accounts. They include two business leaders, a senator, a congressman, two members of Bolsonaro’s cabinet, his chief bodyguard, his head of protocol and a top foreign affairs advisor. Contagion among Brazil’s political elite, health experts said, is a warning about the country’s lack of readiness to combat the pandemic. Sixty-five-year-old Bolsonaro, who tested negative, for weeks has described the coronavirus as “a little flu.” He recently asked Congress to declare a state of emergency to free up more funding. Still, he has resisted calling for Brazilians to stay at home and for businesses to close because of his concerns about harming the economy. And he has berated Brazilian governors and mayors who have taken such steps, even as some members of his inner circle have fallen ill. Bolsonaro, his son Eduardo, security adviser Heleno and two other ministers dined with Trump on Saturday March 7, as cases were rising sharply in the United States. They huddled with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence to take photos. One showed the U.S. president holding a cap that said “Make Brazil Great Again.”      The larger group of Brazilians attended meetings the following two days with investors, business people and public officials, including Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who announced March 13 that he had tested positive for coronavirus.  “We caught it on that trip to Miami, in close contact with one another on the same planes, shuttle buses and hotel meeting rooms,” said Brazilian Congressman Daniel Freitas, 37, who tested positive on his return. He is now in quarantine in his Brasília apartment. Brazilian doctors have not established a definitive transmission chain and cannot say for certain whether the group was infected in the United States. Fabio Wajngarten, Bolsonaro’s communications secretary, tested positive for coronavirus on March 12, two days after arriving home from Florida. Testing then commenced for other members of the delegation. Bolsonaro and Heleno were among those who continued to circulate in public while awaiting their results, much to the dismay of Brazil’s medical community. “It is behavior like an ostrich that sticks its head in the sand,” said epidemiologist José Cássio de Moraes, a member of ABRASCO, Brazil’s largest association of public health experts, doctors and researchers. “It’s not acceptable in any form.” Heleno did not respond to a request for comment. Bolsonaro’s office did not respond to a request for comment. Brazil’s federal response to the pandemic has lagged that of other South America countries even as it leads the continent in confirmed cases of coronavirus. As of Monday, Brazil had recorded 1,891 cases, an eight-fold increase in a week, with 34 deaths tied to the virus, according to the latest Health Ministry figures. The country trailed several of its neighbors in tightening its land borders. Bolsonaro’s administration waited until March 17 to ask Congress to declare the state of emergency. Brazil, like the United State and other late-movers, is now scrambling to produce millions of test kits.  State governors and mayors, meanwhile, have taken the lead in closing public venues and asking Brazilians to stay home. Many private-sector companies have directed employees to work remotely. Bolsonaro has criticized such measures as “extreme.” He has called on Brazilians to fight the disease without bringing the economy to a halt. He recently shook hands with a throng of supporters and leaned into the crowd for selfies. He said in a Friday television interview that churches should keep holding services. Bolsonaro rose to power with massive support from evangelical Christians due to his conservative social agenda.  Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta has warned that Brazil’s healthcare system could collapse next month under a surge of patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, if Brazilians do not adopt rigorous social distancing. Last week he compared Bolsonaro’s mingling with crowds to a smoker ignoring tobacco warnings. ANXIETY IN CONGRESS In the halls of Congress, nervous lawmakers have rushed to protect themselves. Many have fled Brasília to their districts, or are working remotely from their apartments in the capital.  In-person committee hearings have been scrapped and moved online. Plenary sessions cannot have more than 30 lawmakers on the floor, and traditional huddles to discuss legislation are discouraged in both chambers. “Please keep your distance from one another,” Chamber of Deputies Speaker Rodrigo Maia reminded colleagues over the loudspeaker during Wednesday’s session as they quickly approved the state of emergency. Bolsonaro’s approval ratings have taken a beating. A survey published Monday by the Datafolha polling firm showed that just 34% of Brazilians polled thought the president’s job performance was “great” or “good.” That’s the lowest level since he took office last year.  In recent days, residents of São Paulo, Rio and Brasília have taken to banging on pot and pans at their windows and balconies, shouting “Bolsonaro Out!” Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro meets supporters during a protest against Brazil's Congress and Brazilian Supreme Court, in front of the Planalto Palace, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Brasilia, Brazil, March 15, 2020.  REUTERS/Adriano MachadoBolsonaro has brushed off the protests. “This is not the time for political disputes ... to blame me for everything that happens,” he told reporters on Friday. “I am not worried about the pots and pans. I am worried about coronavirus.” Back at the presidential palace, bottles of hand sanitizer have appeared throughout the building, while pregnant and elderly staff are now working from home, people familiar with the situation told Reuters. Bolsonaro has begun holding daily coronavirus meetings, according to a presidential staffer.

      "SYDNEY (Reuters) - As airlines idle thousands of aircraft for which there are no passengers, they are hitting an unprecedented problem: finding a place to park them. Korean Air's passenger planes are parked on the tarmac as overseas flight routes are redueced following the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), at Incheon International Airport in Incheon, South Korea, March 24, 2020. REUTERS/Heo RanTaxiways, maintenance hangars and even runways at major airports are being transformed into giant parking lots for more than 2,500 airliners, the biggest of which takes up about as much room as an eight-story building with a footprint 3/4 the size of an American football field. The number of planes in storage has doubled to more than 5,000 since the start of the year, according to Cirium data, with more expected to be parked in the coming weeks as carriers like Australia’s Qantas Airways Ltd (QAN.AX) and Singapore Airlines Ltd (SIAL.SI) proceed with further announced cuts to flight schedules. In Frankfurt, Germany’s biggest airport is a ghost town of silent airliners. Its northwest landing runway, including taxiways and bridges, has been converted to an aircraft parking lot for Lufthansa (LHAG.DE), Condor and other airlines. Lufthansa brand Swiss has rented parking spots at a military airport close to Zurich. Similar crowds of planes are parked at other major airports, including Hong Kong, Seoul, Berlin and Vienna as well as traditional desert parking lots in Victorville, California, and Marana, Arizona, according to data from flight tracking website FlightRadar24. In Manila, some Philippines Airlines (PAL.PS) jets are parked in the Lufthansa Technik Philippines hangar, an airline official said. Even some smaller airports have been converted to parking lots. Avalon Airport west of Melbourne expects to take 50 planes from Qantas and its low-cost offshoot, Jetstar, according to the airport’s chief executive, Justin Giddings. “It is sad for everyone, the whole industry,” he told Reuters of the groundings, which have led Qantas to put 20,000 staff members on leave.  Qantas is sending 30 engineers to Avalon help maintain the planes so they can re-enter service in three to seven days when demand returns, according to a source with knowledge of the matter. The carrier is also parking about 100 other aircraft at major airports around Australia and its five aging 747s at a desert storage facility in Alice Springs, the source said.  Qantas declined to comment. Asia Pacific Aircraft Storage (APAS) in Alice Springs is also home to SilkAir and Fiji Airways 737 MAX jets as part of a year-long global grounding that has placed further pressure on the ability to find spots to put other jets. “Things are extremely busy,” APAS managing director Tom Vincent said. “There are further aircraft deliveries this week and into the coming weeks.” Some airports, such as Melbourne and Brisbane, said they are providing parking for free. Brisbane Airport said that some international airlines had expressed interest in using its facilities, which can house up to 101 planes, but that no deals had yet been reached. Qantas and Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd (VAH.AX) will use some of the Brisbane spots.  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (0293.HK), one of the first and hardest hit by the coronavirus, has been using remote bays, taxiways and other operational areas at Hong Kong International Airport. In the United States, United Airlines Holdings Inc (UAL.O) and American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) said they are parking planes at maintenance facilities for now, while Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) said it was still looking into the issue. FlightRadar24 data showed Delta had moved a dozen planes to Marana in mid-March and even more to Victorville over the last week.

      "본문 : \n",
      "(Reuters) - Joe Biden’s presidential campaign installed a television studio in his basement over the weekend so the Democratic front-runner could demand bolder action from President Donald Trump on the coronavirus crisis and speak directly to the country. But when he delivered the debut speech on Monday morning, major cable news networks broadcast New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s coronavirus briefing instead. It was yet another sign of the upheaval the global pandemic has wrought on a presidential campaign that just a week ago seemed to be moving full steam toward a Nov. 3 general election matchup between Biden and Trump. Instead of the former vice president wrapping up the Democratic nomination, the coronavirus has taken attention away from the 2020 White House race and threatens to blunt Biden’s momentum by postponing state nominating elections and indefinitely halting in-person campaign events and fundraisers. By contrast, Trump, who initially played down the virus’ impact, has used his daily televised White House briefings on the crisis to project optimism about getting the pandemic under control and grab media attention. The turn of events frustrates Democrats who were eager to move past the nominating contest’s intraparty fighting. It is forcing the Biden campaign to recalibrate quickly to find new ways to connect with voters and donors and compete for attention as Trump leads the national response to the crisis. “You’re not going to have high-dollar donor parties,” said Ed Rendell, the former Pennsylvania governor and Democratic National Committee chairman, who supports Biden. “That’s going to hurt.”  Before the spreading respiratory virus upended American life by shutting down a large swath of the economy and curtailing social activity, Biden’s crowds were growing larger. Donors once cool to his candidacy rushed to make contributions. He had hired a new campaign manager and was thinking about running mates. With decisive wins in a series of state Democratic nominating contests through last Tuesday, he expanded his lead over his lone remaining competitor, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. Although he was holding calls with reporters, donors and advisers from his Delaware home, Biden’s lack of a public event for several days meant he all but disappeared from television. Internet memes questioned his whereabouts. After seeking advice from donors on how to improve Biden’s digital presence in light of the coronavirus, the campaign is responding to their feedback by boosting Biden’s appearances from his in-house studio. Biden’s name recognition from decades in public life will help him stay relevant in the absence of regular TV coverage, Rendell said. NEW METHODS, MIXED RESULTS Several of the Biden campaign’s videos in recent days, including Monday’s speech, were widely viewed online. Still, there were growing pains. On Monday, Biden looked off to the side of the camera for a cue to start speaking and then gestured with his hand during the speech in apparent guidance to a teleprompter operator. Biden’s campaign also is reaching out to consultants and other fundraising experts to seek ideas on how to raise money while people are stuck in their homes, according to a person familiar with the efforts. One idea being considered is “relational organizing,” a technique that Biden’s onetime rival Pete Buttigieg relied on with some success during normal times, the person said. The plan relies on supporters to host virtual fundraisers, hoping to collect small-dollar donations from friends, neighbors and other people in their network. “We’re trying to figure out strategies and how you keep people engaged in the process without offending them,” said one Biden fundraiser not authorized to speak for the campaign. “A lot of people are in shock.” Biden’s campaign is also in talks with third parties about how it can expand its digital operations, according to another person familiar with the matter. “You’re going to be seeing a lot more of me on television and on - excuse me, teleconferencing - as well as online,” Biden told donors during a call on Sunday. Democratic supporters have stepped up their donations to Biden in recent weeks as it appeared increasingly likely he would be the party’s nominee. Biden has phoned or teleconferenced into three events with donors since Friday.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File PhotoBiden supporter and former Paramount Pictures boss Sherry Lansing said all kinds of fundraising were going to become more difficult as people focus their charitable donations on coronavirus causes and as the faltering economy cuts into  incomes. Lansing said something would be lost by not having in-person events, such as the fundraiser she hosted at her Bel Air, California, home earlier this month, where dozens lined up to take pictures with Biden. “When he shook their hands, he had something personal to say to them whether he knew them or not,” she said. “There’s nothing that can replace face-to-face human contact.” Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt in New York; Additional reporting by Jarrett Renshaw in Pennsylvania and Elizabeth Culliford in California; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Peter CooneyOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n",

      "BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Hubei province where the coronavirus pandemic originated will lift travel restrictions on people leaving the region as the epidemic there eases, but other regions will tighten controls as new cases double due to imported infections. Men wearing protective masks stand as people hike along a section of the Great Wall in Badaling in Beijing, on its first day of re-opening after the scenic site's coronavirus related closure, China, March 24, 2020. REUTERS/Thomas PeterThe Hubei Health Commission announced it would lift curbs on outgoing travellers starting March 25, provided they had a health clearance code.  The provincial capital Wuhan, where the virus first appeared and which has been in total lockdown since Jan. 23, will see its travel restrictions lifted on April 8.  However, the risk from overseas infections appears to be on the rise, prompting tougher screening and quarantine measures in major cities such as the capital Beijing.  China had 78 new cases on Monday, the National Health Commission said, a two-fold increase from Sunday. Of the new cases, 74 were imported infections, up from 39 imported cases a day earlier.  The Chinese capital Beijing was the hardest-hit, with a record 31 new imported cases, followed by southern Guangdong province with 14 and the financial hub of Shanghai with nine. The total number of imported cases stood at 427 as of Monday. Only four new cases were local transmissions. One was in Wuhan which had not reported a new infection in five days. Wuhan residents will soon be allowed to leave with a health tracking code, a QR code, which will have an individual’s health status linked to it. Related CoverageChina health commission says virus transmission risks remainChina says most of its imported coronavirus cases involve Chinese nationalsIn other parts of the country, authorities have continued to impose tougher screening and quarantine and have diverted international flights from Beijing to other Chinese cities, but that has not stemmed the influx of Chinese nationals, many of whom are students returning home from virus-hit countries.  Beijing’s city government tightened quarantine rules for individuals arriving from overseas, saying on Tuesday that everyone entering the city will be subject to centralised quarantine and health checks. [B9N2AR01N] The southern city of Shenzhen said on Tuesday it will test all arrivals and the Chinese territory of Macau will ban visitors from the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan.  The number of local infections from overseas arrivals - the first of which was reported in the southern travel hub of Guangzhou on Saturday - remains very small.   On Monday, Beijing saw its first case of a local person being infected by an international traveller arriving in China. Shanghai reported a similar case, bringing the total number of such infections to three so far.  CONCERNS ABOUT NEW WAVE OF INFECTIONS The rise in imported cases and the lifting of restrictions in some cities to allow people to return to work and kickstart the battered Chinese economy has raised concerns of a second wave of infections. A private survey on Tuesday suggested that a 10-11% contraction in first-quarter gross domestic product in the world’s second largest economy “is not unreasonable”.    Slideshow (3 Images)The epidemic has hammered all sectors of the economy - from manufacturing to tourism. To persuade businesses to reopen, policymakers have promised loans, aids and subsidies. In the impoverished province of Gansu, government officials are each required to spend at least 200 yuan ($28.25) a week to spur the recovery of the local catering industry. The official China Daily warned in an editorial on Tuesday that maintaining stringent restrictions on people’s movements would “now do more harm than good”.

      "LONDON (Reuters) - Global equities rebounded almost 2% on Tuesday, off near four-year lows, and the dollar slipped as investors pinned hopes on unprecedented stimulus steps by the U.S Federal Reserve and other policymakers to ease strains in financial markets. FILE PHOTO: Pedestrians wearing face masks walk near an overpass with an electronic board showing stock information, following an outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), at Lujiazui financial district in Shanghai, China March 17, 2020. REUTERS/Aly SongWhile the measures such as the Fed’s offer of unlimited bond-buying won’t immediately mitigate the economic devastation inflicted by the coronavirus outbreak, they will launch more dollars into world markets, allowing companies, funds and banks to access cash to pay creditors, supplier and end-investors. The prospect had not cheered Wall Street for very long on Monday, with losses of 2-3% on major indexes, but the mood improved on Tuesday, possibly as many other central banks and governments looked set to join the fray. Wall Street futures pointed to stocks opening 4% higher, while a pan-European equity index also rallied a similar amount. “Today there is a strong recovery connected to the move that the Fed has introduced this massive weapon,” said Francois Savary, CIO of wealth manager Prime Partners, noting the Fed had needed to resolve funding markets seize-ups as a priority. “The key issue at the end of the day is that we need to deal with a credit markets that is completely closed. First they needed to stop this increase in bond yields... second, they needed to make sure that there is a return of liquidity in the credit then it will be equities - in that sequence.” The Fed will not only buy unlimited amounts of assets but also expand its mandate to corporate and municipal bonds and backstop a series of other measures that analysts estimate will deliver $4 trillion-plus in loans to non-financial firms. There were also signs of progress in Congress on a $2 trillion U.S. stimulus deal, which Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin hoped was “very close”. Other countries are unveiling their own measures - South Korea’s ravaged market climbed 8.6% after the government doubled a planned economic rescue package to 100 trillion won ($80 billion). In China, mainland stocks posted their biggest gain in three weeks with a rise of almost 3% while Japan’s Nikkei soared 7%, its biggest daily rise since Feb 2016.  Not everyone was optimistic the buoyant mood would last noting, for instance, that global coronavirus infections now top 350,000 with scores of countries in lockdown. China too posted a  rise in new infections brought in from abroad.  (Graphic: China's coronavirus cases JPG, here)     “Markets are continuing to bounce up on the latest policy announcements and then sliding back down as the economic reality of the situation re-emerges,” Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said. Still, the plan calmed nerves in bond markets, where yields on two-year Treasuries hit their lowest since 2013. Ten-year yields were at 0.8339%, from last week’s peak of 1.28%. Yields inched higher on Tuesday as equities rallied. ALL ABOUT THE ECONOMY Just how much the virus is ravaging the global economy is evident in a series of growth forecast downgrades and advance readings of purchasing managers indexes (PMI) across the world’s biggest economies. German activity plunged to the lowest since the 2009 crisis, driven by a record services contraction, while French activity hit all-time lows. Japan posted its biggest-ever services decline. “Economies around the world are going offline and that is devastating for economic activity, it’s creating the most robust dislocation in financial markets in living memory,” said George Boubouras, head of research at K2 Asset Management in Melbourne. For now however, the prospect of massive Fed funding pushed the greenback 0.5% lower against rivals, off three-year peaks. It fell similarly to the yen and slumped 1% versus the euro. Commodity and emerging market currencies also benefited, with the Australian dollar up almost 2% to $0.59315 and well off 17-year lows. There was some relief on the market volatility front too. A gauge of expected euro-dollar swings eased below 12%, from above 14% on Monday, and a measure of U.S. equity volatility slipped to one-week lows around 57 points.

G20 finance ministers and central bankers agreed during a separate video conference on Monday to develop an “action plan” to respond to the outbreak, which the International Monetary Fund expects will trigger a global recession. A subsequent statement from the Saudi G20 secretariat offered few details. The extraordinary leaders’ summit will be complicated by an oil price war between two members, Saudi Arabia and Russia, and rising tensions between two others, the United States and China, over the origin of the virus, which has infected 378,000 people globally and killed more than 16,500. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has welcomed the fiscal and monetary steps taken by some countries, but said more would be needed, especially in the fiscal arena. Agathe Demarais, global forecasting director at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said given monetary policy constraints, the G20 countries’ only option to support growth might be fiscal stimulus, but even that remains in question. “This is because the introduction of fiscal stimulus measures may raise the risk of a debt crisis once the coronavirus epidemic is over; such a prospect would have a devastating effect on global growth,” she said. “This is something that G20 leaders will have in mind if they go for stimulus packages.” Reporting by Stephen KalinOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n",

      "WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern urged New Zealanders on Tuesday to reduce contacts to a bare minimum to help fight the coronavirus, as the country prepared for a one-month lockdown. New Zealand’s cases of the coronavirus crossed the 100 mark this week as the government imposed self-isolation for everyone, with all non-essential services, schools and offices to be shut for a month from midnight on Wednesday. New Zealand has fewer infections than many other countries but Ardern’s government wants to move fast to halt the spread. It was one of the first to force all arriving travellers into self-isolation and to ban indoor and outdoor gatherings. Cases in neighbouring Australia have soared to 1,886 but it has yet to announce a nationwide lockdown. “Simplest thing is to stay at home ... that’s how we will save lives,” Ardern told a news conference at parliament. “The underlying principle of an alert level 4 is to reduce contact between people to the bare minimum,” she said. Parliament will sit on Wednesday to impose the state of emergency and lockdown, she said. The prime minister said the lockdown would give the country of about 5 million people a good chance of beating the virus but it would only work if everyone followed the restrictions. New Zealand has a total of 155 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, the disease associated with the coronavirus, with four local transmission cases. It has had no deaths. Related CoverageNew Zealand confirms 40 new coronavirus casesUnder the lockdown, people can go out for a walk or take their children out but they have to keep a distance of 2 metres from others. They can also go to supermarkets. On Tuesday, office staff were preparing to work from home while students moved out of their hostels and cafes shut down. Domestic airports and other regional transport services were choked as people headed home before the lockdown.  In the capital of Wellington, ferry services going from the North Island to the South Island were packed, as were supermarkets with people stocking up with food despite government assurances the country will be well supplied. ‘WON’T LOSE HOMES’ Retail banks agreed to offer a six-month principal and interest payment holiday for mortgage holders and small business customers, the finance minister, Grant Robertson, said. “A six-month mortgage holiday for people whose incomes have been affected by COVID-19 will mean people won’t lose their homes as a result of the economic disruption caused by this virus,” Robertson said. The government and banks would also implement a NZ$6.25 billion ($3.62 billion) business finance guarantee scheme for small and medium-sized businesses, he said. The scheme will include a limit of NZ$500,000 per loan and will apply to firms with a turnover of between NZ$250,000 and NZ$80 million per annum. FILE PHOTO: New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern pauses during a news conference prior to the anniversary of the mosque attacks that took place the prior year in Christchurch, New Zealand, March 13, 2020. REUTERS/Martin HunterThe government will carry 80% of the credit risk, with the other 20% to be carried by the banks, Robertson said. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) had decided to reduce banks’ core funding ratios to 50% from 75%, further helping banks make credit available.

In Nevada, BLM will offer 45 parcels covering 70,110 acres (28,372 hectares) and in Montana it will auction eight parcels covering 5,180 acres (2,100 hectares). The Colorado sale is for 20 parcels on 18,960 acres (7,670 hectares). Drilling on federal lands is a crucial part of President Donald Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda to maximize domestic production of fossil fuels. But the industry is in crisis as countries including the United States take unprecedented steps to contain the coronavirus pandemic that has curbed demand for products such as gasoline and jet fuel. U.S. oil prices have dropped roughly half since the middle of February to about $24 a barrel. Last week, the United States held an auction for oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico that generated the lowest total of high bids for any domestic offshore auction since 2016. Earlier this month, BLM held a lease sale in Utah that received mostly minimum bids of $2 an acre. “In this environment, it is impossible for the American taxpayer to expect anywhere near a fair return on oil and gas leases,” Taxpayers for Common Sense, a federal budget watchdog organization, and Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship, a non-profit conservation group, said in a joint statement last week. Department of Interior spokesman Conner Swanson did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. Last week, he said lease sales were “being evaluated on a case-by-case basis.” BLM is a division of the Interior Department.

REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File PhotoFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Tesla bought hospital ventilators in China and shipped them to the United States, CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday. Tesla’s purchase comes as governments across the globe appeal to automakers and aerospace companies help procure or make ventilators and other medical equipment. “China had an oversupply, so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed, Philips & Medtronic ventilators on Friday night & airshipped them to LA,” Musk said on Twitter. California Governor Gavin Newsom on Tuesday said the state would receive 1,000 ventilators from Tesla as the United States braces to deal with an influx of patients infected by the coronavirus. Authorities are hoping large-scale manufacturers can use their low-cost supply chains and digital design expertise, including 3D printing, and repurpose some factories in order to make up the expected shortfall in vital medical hardware. Carmakers have cautioned that assembling delicate medical equipment to standards adequate for use in hospital intensive care units remains a challenge.

      "PARIS/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Evidence that the coronavirus pandemic is hammering the global economy mounted on Tuesday as business activity surveys from Australia and Japan to Western Europe showed record falls, with data for the United States expected to be just as dire. FILE PHOTO: A man stands next to shelves empty of fresh meat in a supermarket, as the number of worldwide coronavirus cases continues to grow,  in London, Britain, March 15, 2020. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls“The coronavirus outbreak represents a major external shock to the macro outlook, akin to a large-scale natural disaster,” analysts at BlackRock Investment Institute said in a note. Activity in the 19 European Union countries that share the euro currency crumbled in March as nationwide lockdowns to curb the spread of the disease, which have shuttered shops, restaurants and offices, took hold.  IHS Markit’s flash composite Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the euro zone, seen as a good gauge of economic health, plummeted to a record low of 31.4 this month from February’s 51.6. That was by far the biggest one-month fall since the survey began in mid-1998 and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll which gave a median prediction of 38.8. In France, services fell to a record low and manufacturing saw its steepest drop since the global financial crisis. “Taken together, these declines suggest GDP is collapsing at an annual rate approaching double digits,” IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said. A PMI for the services sector in Germany, Europe’s largest economy, also showed a record contraction in activity.  A sister survey showed post-Brexit Britain’s economy shrinking at a record pace, faster than during the 2008-09 financial crisis. IHS Markit said the March figures suggested the euro zone economy could shrink by around 2% quarter-on-quarter in the first three months of 2020, and the escalation of measures to contain the virus could steepen the downturn in Q2. U.S. manufacturing and services PMI data, due later on Tuesday, are also expected to come in at multi-year lows. After an initial outbreak in China brought the world’s second-largest economy to a virtual halt last month, an ever-growing number of countries and territories have reported a spike in infections and deaths. Entire regions have been placed on lockdown and in some places soldiers are patrolling the streets to keep consumers and workers indoors, halting services and production and breaking global supply chains. Mirroring the emptying of supermarket shelves around the world, indebted corporates have rushed into money markets to hoard dollars, with a global shortage of dollar funding threatening to cripple firms from airlines to retailers. PMI surveys from Japan showed the services sector shrinking at its fastest pace on record this month and factory activity contracting at its quickest in a decade. This was consistent with a 4% contraction in the economy in 2020, Capital Economics senior economist Marcel Theliant said. The likely postponement of the Tokyo Olympics is expected to deal a heavy blow to the world’s third-largest economy. In Australia, the CBA Services PMI fell to a record low of 39.8 as restaurants, cafes and tourism were hit hard by travel bans and cancellations of events and concerts.  INFINITE STIMULUS With most asset markets tanking, global central banks have been rolling out extraordinary measures on an almost daily basis to stop the rot. In its latest drastic step, the U.S. Federal Reserve on Monday promised bottomless dollar funding. For the first time, the Fed will back purchases of corporate bonds, backstop direct loans to companies and “soon” will roll out a program to get credit to small and medium-sized businesses. It will also expand its asset purchases by “as much as needed.”  The Fed last week slashed borrowing costs to zero and took other emergency steps to keep the commercial paper, U.S. Treasury debt and foreign dollar funding markets functional. But some analysts say infinite monetary policy easing may not be enough and fiscal steps are crucial. The latest U.S. effort on that front remains stalled in the Senate as Democrats said it contained too little money for hospitals and not enough limits on funds for big business. Finance and monetary leaders from the world’s 20 largest economies agreed on Monday to develop an “action plan” to respond to the pandemic that the International Monetary Fund now expects to trigger a global recession, but offered no specifics. “For the U.S. economy to be able to come out of the current crisis and the ongoing recession relatively unscathed, more radical policy interventions will be needed in the next few weeks,” Anna Stupnytska, global head of macro and investment strategy at Fidelity International, said.

REUTERS/Simon DawsonSpeculation is mounting that data due on Thursday will show U.S. jobless claims rose an eye-watering 1 million last week, with forecasts ranging as high as 4 million.  Goldman Sachs warned the U.S. economy could contract by an annual rate of 24% in the second quarter, 2-1/2 times greater than the previous biggest contraction in the period after World War Two.

      "BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s desire to rapidly reopen the economy despite signs the coronavirus is still spreading may backfire, with higher deaths and citizens remaining fearful of going out, some investors said. FILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 19, 2020. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File PhotoU.S. markets have been roiled by the spread of the virus in the country and as states have shut parts of their economies.  Trump said on Monday that at the end of a 15-day shutdown period, which would run to the end of the month, “we will make a decision as to which way we want to go.”  Last week, Trump urged Americans to halt most social activities for 15 days. It is unclear what power Trump actually has to simply turn the economy back on by executive order. News of Trump reopening the U.S. economy anytime soon would not be taken well by investors, who remain anxious about the coronavirus’ uncertain trajectory and its economic toll, said Axel Merk, chief investment officer of Merk Investments.  “Markets will react badly because they have learned that this approach doesn’t work,” Merk said. “From a medical point of view, you have to break the exponential growth and you do that with shelter in place policies.” The S&P 500 Index .SPX sank 3% on Monday. It is down more than 30% from its Feb. 19 peak and is at levels not seen since the end of 2016, giving up nearly all of its gains from before Trump was elected.  BLEAK ESTIMATES Initial estimates of the pandemic’s economic fallout have grown bleaker in recent days.  U.S. unemployment could hit 30% and second-quarter economic output could be half the norm, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said.  Jennifer Pline, head of wealth management for Cambridge Trust in Boston, said it is too soon to judge whether to reopen the economy just yet.  “As we’re just starting to close things down fairly tightly, we need to wait a while until we get more traction and less contagion with the virus.” The cost of a mistake could be deadly. A March 16 study by Imperial College in London predicts 2.2 million deaths in the United States in an unmitigated epidemic, with critical care bed capacity exceeded as early as the second week in April. Economists at Northwestern University and Berlin’s Freie University estimated an “optimal containment policy” in the United States would deepen the subsequent recession but save 600,000 lives.     Ellis Phifer, market strategist for Raymond James in Memphis, Tenn. said he has struggled with the question of whether it would be best to reopen parts of the economy. “It’s really hard to determine which costs more,” Phifer said of the dueling approaches of lifting restrictions sooner or later. On balance, he would be inclined to follow the advice of public health experts like Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who have largely advocated for more restrictions.  TESTING KEY     In an interview last week, Richmond Federal Reserve president Thomas Barkin said any call to try to resume normal economic activity will depend on widespread testing quick enough that businesses can establish protocols to ensure worker and customer safety.  David Kotok, chairman & chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors, said what is imperative is to get accurate antibody tests, and to read the recovery rate as well as confirmed cases and deaths. “I don’t think the market will get the economic growth if people are dying all over the place,” said Kotok.   Others thought that the more important thing would be to get the economy back open.  “You leave this USA shut for another 60 days and you may have no economy or healthcare left,” said John Lekas at Leader Capital.   Rob Arnott, founder of asset manager Research Affiliates said the toll of job losses and other economic hardship that may stem from shutdowns and other measures could potentially be more harmful than the virus itself.  “Our way of handling this will kill a lot more people than it saves,” said Arnott.  But now the measures are taken and the population is fearful, there may be no going back.  Gregory Daco, Chief U.S, Economist at Oxford Economics, said even if the lockdowns were lifted, “businesses and households would remain very cautious, and financial intermediation would remain under stress... And, with the rest of the world under lockdown, you would presumably further alienate yourself.” Reporting by Ross Kerber, Megan Davies, Ira Iosebashvili, Noel Randewich, Howard Schneider; writing by Megan Davies; editing by Lincoln Feast.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n",

      "본문 : \n",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The coronavirus is spreading deeper into Latin America, a region home to about 8.5% of the world’s population that many expects believe could be among the worst affected by COVID-19. A kid is pictured in the Alemao slums complex during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil March 22, 2020. REUTERS/Ricardo MoraesHeavily reliant on commodity exports, tourism and remittances, Latin America’s fragile economies and vulnerable populations are likely to suffer. JPMorgan expects a 2020 GDP contraction exceeding 2% across the region and over 3% in Colombia, Brazil and Mexico. Below, Reuters examines World Bank data that shine a light on just how vulnerable Latin America may be to the virus’ spread. AGE Although much remains unknown about COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, it appears older people are more vulnerable.  Latin America has a younger population compared to some other parts of the world. Less than 9% of its population is aged 65 and above, compared with 20% in the European Union and 16% in North America. In Sub-Saharan Africa, 3% of the population is aged 65 and over. Meanwhile, 67% of Latin America’s population is aged between 15-64, a slightly higher share than North America (66%), the EU (65%) and the world as a whole (65%). HEALTHCARE Latin America dedicates about 9% of its gross domestic product to healthcare, while the EU allocates 10%. North America spends 16.58% of its GDP on healthcare. On a per capita basis, Latin America spends nearly $700 on healthcare, compared with $3,211 in the EU and $9,326 in North America.  Latin America has 2.2 physicians per 1,000 people, slightly more than the rest of the world (1.5), but below the EU and North America, which have 3.6 and 2.6 doctors per 1,000 people, respectively.  By comparison, East Asia and the Pacific have 1.6 doctors for every 1,000 people.  Latin America has 4.7 nurses and midwives per 1,000 people, versus 3.4 per 1,000 in the rest of the world. The EU has 8.6, while North America has 8.7 per 1,0000.  Compared with other regions, Latin America has relatively few hospital beds per 1,000 people - 2.2 compared with 5.6 in the EU. The rest of the world has 2.7 per 1,000 people. In Latin America, about 14% of deaths are caused by either communicable diseases, maternal, prenatal and nutrition conditions. Although that percentage is low compared with South Asia, where 27% of deaths are attributed to such causes, it is well below the 5% in the EU and North America.  COVID-19 appears to pose a greater threat to people with pre-existing health conditions. In Latin America, nearly 10% of people between 20 and 79 have diabetes, slightly below the 10.5% in North America. In the EU, just 6.3% of that age group have diabetes, while in East Asia and the Pacific, 8.2% do.  Nearly 15% of Latin Americans aged 15 or over smoke, compared with about a fifth in North America and more than a quarter in the EU and East Asia and the Pacific.  Although the risks of coronavirus to people with HIV are not known, Latin America’s HIV infection prevalence for people aged 15-49 is the same as that of North America - 0.4%. SOCIAL ISSUES Nearly 4.5% of Latin America’s population lives on less than $1.90 a day, compared with 10% across the rest of the world, 1.3% in East Asia and the Pacific, and 7.2% in the Middle East and North America. In Sub-Saharan Africa, 42.3% of the population lives on under $1.90 a day.  Around a fifth of Latin America’s urban population lives in slums; in East Asia and the Pacific, just over a quarter does. Worldwide, nearly a third of city-dwellers lives in slums. More than half of the urban population in sub-Saharan Africa lives in shanties.  Although Latin America has some of the world’s largest cities, including Sao Paulo and Mexico City, the region has a population density of just 32 people per square kilometer. In the EU, the population density is 121 people/sq. km, while in East Asia and the Pacific it is 95/sq. km. In North America, there are 20 people per square kilometer.

      "CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - When panic over the coronavirus spurred a run on hand sanitizer in Cape Town, gin maker Andre Pienaar realized there was something he could do with all the waste alcohol his small distillery produces. Distiller Andre Pienaar mixes up a batch of  70 percent alcohol, a by-product of the gin making process, which he makes available as hand sanitiser to restrict the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Cape Town, South Africa, March 19, 2020. REUTERS/Mike HutchingsHe had 140 liters of the 70 percent ethanol waste - called “gin heads” in the trade - just sitting around, so he posted on social media that anyone who needed some could have it for free to turn into the hand wash at home. “The response was crazy. It was finished in three hours and there was a limit of one liter per person,” he told Reuters. He has now started selling the ethanol his Pienaar and Son Distilling Company is still producing. “There is nothing on the shelves for people other than soap at the moment. It is just another option to help protect people,” he said. Across Africa, dwindling supplies of sanitizer and surgical masks could prove a boon for entrepreneurs seeking to plug shortages. Amateur chemists in Nigeria and Kenya are mixing up hand wash, while enterprising tailors in Rwanda are sewing their own masks. Health officials warn that wearing masks in public won’t protect you from the virus, and say sanitizer only works if it’s more than 60 percent alcohol - and even then soap and water are better. But those warnings have not stopped customers flocking to Alexander Nshimiyimana, a tailor based in Kigali’s main market. He is using kitenge, a kaleidoscopic local fabric, to make masks that are not only cheaper but much prettier than the standard hospital-style ones. “It is a kind of opportunity to some people to make money. It is also (an) opportunity to innovate,” Nshimiyimana said. The continent of 1.3 billion has recorded only around 1,100 cases in 43 countries, with 39 deaths, a fraction of the more than 305,000 people infected and more than 13,000 deaths worldwide. But there are concerns that Africa’s creaky health infrastructure could be overrun as the virus spreads. “A mask will not protect you from the infection, it will protect others if you wear it from getting infected should you have symptoms. So in this respect also a piece of cloth works,” James Ayodele, spokesman of the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) Africa office. Ayodele said that the CDC also advised against making sanitizer at home because it contains alcohol at a potentially dangerous high concentration. But Moji Kusanu, a chef in Nigeria’s commercial hub of Lagos, decided to respond to an obvious shortage - after prices shot up to 1,700 naira ($5.55) for a 200ml bottle, from 200 naira before. She customized an online sanitizer recipe, which recommended mixing alcohol with aloe vera gel, by adding glycerine for extra moisturizing effect. “Sometimes, when you are out you cannot wash your hands. sanitizers can ... make a difference,” she said Additional reporting by Themistocle Hakizimana and Jackson Njehia in Kigale, Angela Ukomadu in Lagos and Giulia Paravicini in Addis Ababa; Writing by Tim Cocks; Editing by Andrew HeavensOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n"

      "본문 : \n",
      "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Indonesian ride-hailer and payments firm Gojek is experiencing a rise in food delivery orders but a fall in rides across Southeast Asia as it readies measures to help merchants and drivers deal with the coronavirus outbreak, co-CEO Andre Soelistyo said on Tuesday. Having evolved from a ride-hailing service founded in 2010 to a one-stop app via which users can make online payments and order food and services, the $10 billion firm is active in 4 countries and owns a startup e-wallet app in the Philippines.   “In Singapore, the drop is less significant than expected” Soelistyo told Reuters in an interview. “In Vietnam the impact has been more severe, we see food delivery increasing, while transport is reducing. It’s been similar in Thailand” Soelistyo said the company had seen the same trends in its main market of Indonesia and expected those dynamics to increase as the capital Jakarta goes into a two-week emergency period.  He told Reuters Gojek had launched contactless deliveries and was working with drivers and merchants on the sanitation of  vehicles and other health safety measures.  The archipelago of 260 million people has confirmed 688 cases of the virus and 55 deaths in last two weeks, mainly concentrated in Jakarta where Gojek is headquartered.  The firm, which closed an additional $1.2 billion funding round last week and is backed by Google and Singapore investor Temasek, will put a lot of its plans on hold, Soelistyo said.  “We expect that in the next few months when we see an actual recovery, we can continue the plans we have,” he told Reuters. “In the meantime, we need to be prudent on capital management and cost management.” Soelistyo called talks of a merger with rival Grab “market speculation” and said the company was focused on the virus crisis. Gojek said on Tuesday it had created a fund to support its drivers and partner merchants whose income has been affected by the coronavirus, with Gojek’s annual salary increase budget redirected to the fund and the senior management team donating 25 percent of their salaries. Soelistyo said the fund would launch with a budget of $6 million. The CEO said additionally that Gojek was in discussions with the Indonesian government about stimulus measures to help their drivers, many of whom lease their vehicles and have to keep up rental payments when income drops, and noted authorities were looking at temporarily waving interest on motor vehicle loans. Soelistyo said developers from Gojek and other large Indonesian technology firms were also working with the government to create a contact tracing app for the country, similar to one launched by Singapore on Monday.

      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury secretary and the Senate Democratic leader voiced confidence late on Monday for a deal to be reached soon on a far-reaching coronavirus economic stimulus package that had been stalled in the U.S. Senate as lawmakers haggled over it. Negotiators made great progress on the bipartisan, $2-trillion stimulus measure on Monday, but without striking a final pact as they had hoped, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters. “There are still a couple of open issues,” Mnuchin said, just before midnight. “I think we are very hopeful that this can be closed out tomorrow.” Schumer said he thought the Senate could vote as soon as Tuesday, adding, “It’s a huge bill of $2 trillion with many different moving parts.” They gave no specifics about remaining obstacles, but Democrats have said the stimulus plan originally proposed by Republicans contained too little money for states and hospitals and not enough restrictions on a fund to help big businesses. Two attempts to advance a Republican measure in the Senate failed in the past two days, despite the party’s majority. In the second attempt, on Monday, the 49-46 vote fell short of the 60 needed to advance, as only one Democrat voted with Republicans. Congress has already passed two packages of legislation to blunt the economic toll of the pandemic, which has killed more than 550 people in the United States and sickened more than 43,800, thrown millions out of work and led state governors to order nearly a third of the nation’s population to stay at home. Tempers have frayed as Republicans accused Democrats of obstruction during a national emergency, even as talks continued for days. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin walks to the meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) (not pictured) during negotiations on a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) relief package on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 23, 2020.      REUTERS/Joshua RobertsTRUMP LASHES OUT Republican President Donald Trump lashed out on Twitter just as Mnuchin and Schumer spoke, accusing Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi of taking an “extended vacation” and then making demands he would never agree to. “The Democrats want the virus to win?” Trump said in the Twitter post. “They are asking for things that have nothing to do with our great workers or companies.” Democrats insist any agreement must include more oversight provisions for a $500 billion fund for large businesses, to avoid giving corporate leaders a blank check. Asked about that, Trump responded to reporters, “I’ll be the oversight.” Mnuchin, the Trump administration’s point person on coronavirus legislation, said he would return to the Capitol at 9:30 a.m. EDT (1330 GMT) on Tuesday to resume discussions. He told reporters Trump would like to have a deal and was hopeful it could be concluded on Tuesday. The administration launched a major push last week for action to blunt the economic impact from the pandemic, and an accompanying steep decline in the stock market, after Trump himself spent several weeks dismissing the virus’ risks. The Senate measure includes financial aid for ordinary Americans, small businesses and critically affected industries, such as airlines. Republicans said Democrats were seeking to add unrelated provisions, such as expanded tax credits for wind and solar power and increased leverage for labor unions. Democrats said provisions sought by Republicans would exclude nonprofit groups from receiving small-business aid, and extend a sexual abstinence-education program due to expire in May. Pelosi, who has been involved in the Senate talks, also released her own counterproposal, which would add billions of dollars to help states conduct elections by mail. Slideshow (9 Images)Republicans hold a slim 53-47 majority in the chamber, short of the 60 votes needed to advance most legislation. But the coronavirus has trimmed their ranks, giving Democrats more leverage. On Sunday, Republican Senator Rand Paul said he tested positive for coronavirus. But since he kept circulating on Capitol Hill after getting tested, three other Republicans decided to self-quarantine as a precaution.

      "TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp have agreed to work together on developing smart cities and will invest 200 billion yen ($1.8 billion) in each other to cement the relationship, the two companies said on Tuesday. FILE PHOTO: A man walks past a Toyota logo at the Tokyo Motor Show, in Tokyo, Japan October 24, 2019. REUTERS/Edgar SuThe two companies will develop a data platform which will compile and analyze information from homes, vehicles, and public institutions, which will be used to create new services focusing on transportation, health, and energy usage. Under the agreement, Toyota will take a 2.07% stake in Japan’s biggest telecoms company, while NTT will take a 0.9% stake in the automaker. The platform will be rolled out at the prototype, zero-emissions, hydrogen-powered city near Mt. Fuji in Japan which Toyota is developing to incorporate smart homes, robotics as well as autonomous driving and AI technologies. After decades spent focusing on making and selling cars, Toyota is increasingly turning to partners in the technology sector to help develop expensive new vehicle technologies as it tries to transform itself into a mobility services company. “It is necessary not only for each company to engage in its own projects but also for both companies to work closely in jointly building and operating the ‘Smart City Platform’,” the companies said in a statement.  A growing number of global tech giants including China’s Tencent Holdings, Alphabet, Samsung Electronics, and Panasonic, are looking at developing hi-tech, connected cities, although many remain in the early planning stages. The partnership between Toyota and NTT will build on an existing collaboration under which the companies are jointly developing technology for connected cars.  Toyota has also tied up with other domestic telecoms firms to come up with new technologies, including its partnership with SoftBank Corp to design and market an on-demand, self-driving service platform which will be used in Toyota’s prototype city. NTT sees smart city-related solutions as a growth area as phone usage plateaus at home. It has partnered with the city of Las Vegas to use its data systems technology to analyze real-time car traffic and crowd density data to enhance public security.
